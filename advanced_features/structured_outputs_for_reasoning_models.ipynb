    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'c122f5a4001e413b9274136dfabd8591', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.455711841583252, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766151948.6311836}}</strong>"

First, I need to clarify what exactly they\\'re asking for. The capital of France is definitely Paris. Got that part right.\\n\\nNow, they mentioned \"information,\" which is a bit vague. I guess they mean general details about the city and its population. So, I should include the name of the city, its geographical location, maybe some interesting facts or landmarks. Also, the population numbers are crucial. I remember Paris has a diverse population, so I should look up the latest data. \\n\\nWait, how do I present this in JSON? JSON requires key-value pairs. So, I\\'ll structure it with keys like \"Name,\" \"Location,\" \"Interesting_Facts,\" and \"Population.\" For \"Population,\" I should probably include both the current estimate and the projected future growth, like the 2030 figure. \\n\\nLet me check some data points. The population of Paris was around 2.16 million in 2021, I think. In 2030, it\\'s projected to be about 2.34 million. That\\'s a bit of growth. I should mention that it\\'s growing mainly due to arrivals from various countries, especially from the Middle East and Asia.\\n\\nFor interesting facts, maybe I\\'ll list a few. Paris has a reputation as Europe\\'s cultural capital, with landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. It\\'s also the political center with its Basilica of the National Shrine. Factories like Renault are also based there, contributing to the city\\'s economic power.\\n\\nGeographically, Paris is known as a seine riverfront city with a medinas, which gives it that romantic, historic vibe. The city\\'s cosmopolitan nature is another key point, with an international population.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is properly formatted, each key has a colon and the value. No typos there. Also, the population numbers should be accurate. Maybe cross-reference with recent sources to ensure up-to-date information.\\n\\nAlright, so putting it all together: Name is Paris, Location is Île-de-France, Interesting Facts include landmarks, cultural and political significance, and notable industries. Population includes current and future stats. I think that covers everything the user asked for. Hopefully, this provides a clear and concise JSON response.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly!

      "\n",
      "Next, the population. I recall that Paris is one of the most populous cities globally, but I'm not sure of the exact number. I think it's somewhere around 2 million. Wait, maybe it's a bit higher? I should double-check that. Oh yeah, I believe the population is approximately 2,170,000 people as of the latest estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to present this information in JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format, so I'll structure it with a key-value pair. The keys should be \"capital\" and \"population\". The values will be the corresponding data: \"Paris\" for the capital and the number for the population.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. The entire structure should be valid JSON, so I'll use the correct syntax with commas and colons in the right places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look like this:\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2170000\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers everything the user asked for. They probably need this for a quick data reference or maybe integrating it into another application. Ensuring accuracy is key, so I'll stick with the most recent data I have. If the population figure changes, they can update it themselves, but for now, this should be correct.\n",
