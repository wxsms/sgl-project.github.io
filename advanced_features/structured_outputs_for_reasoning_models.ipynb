    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

They asked, \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, the user is asking for two main things: information and population of the capital of France. They also want it in JSON format. I know the capital of France is Paris, so that part is straightforward.\\n\\nNow, under information, what do they need? Probably the administrative details—like the prefecture number, which is a unique identifier. Also, theNiEXT codes, which I think are used for geographic identifiers. Additionally, Paris is an Île-de-France, so that\\'s another piece of information.\\n\\nFor population, I should provide an estimate. It\\'s important to mention that the population figure might change, so I should note that it\\'s approximate. I should also include the metropolitan area population to give a better context, might be around 12 million or so.\\n\\nPutting this all together, I need to create a JSON structure with keys for Information and Population, each containing an object with relevant details. I\\'ll make sure to include all the required fields without making the JSON too complicated.\\n\\nWait, I should double-check the population numbers to ensure accuracy. Let me think, Paris\\'s population is about 2.17 million residents, and considering the metropolitan area, maybe 12.2 million. That sounds about right.\\n\\nAlso, I need to format everything properly in JSON. Each key should be in quotes, and the values should be in brackets after \":\". No trailing commas, I remember that\\'s important for JSON syntax. Alright, putting it all together now.\\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user probably just needs a clear and concise JSON output for comparison or integration into another system. They might not have specified any particular fields, so covering the essentials should suffice. Hopefully, this meets their needs.\\n</think>\\n\\nSure! Here\\'s the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"Information\": {\\n    \"AdministrativeAreaCode\": \"92\",\\n    \"GeographicID\": \"Mjęszczasuringdom\",\\n    \"Type\": \"prefecture\",\\n    \"Name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"andi\": \"Île-de-France\"\\n  },\\n  \"Population\": {\\n    \"Population\": 2165000, // Approximate population of Paris\\n    \"MetropolitanAreaPopulation\": 12245000 // Approximate metropolitan area population\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 419, 1196, 594, 3239, 13, 2379, 4588, 11, 330, 35127, 752, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 279, 4718, 3561, 1189, 88190, 11, 1077, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 1378, 1887, 2513, 25, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 2379, 1083, 1366, 432, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 358, 1414, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 773, 429, 949, 374, 30339, 382, 7039, 11, 1212, 1995, 11, 1128, 653, 807, 1184, 30, 37154, 279, 22707, 3565, 2293, 4803, 279, 89445, 552, 1372, 11, 892, 374, 264, 4911, 12816, 13, 7281, 11, 279, 56494, 5722, 13912, 11, 892, 358, 1744, 525, 1483, 369, 45039, 47216, 13, 22406, 11, 12095, 374, 458, 59108, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 11, 773, 429, 594, 2441, 6573, 315, 1995, 382, 2461, 7042, 11, 358, 1265, 3410, 458, 16045, 13, 1084, 594, 2989, 311, 6286, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 2578, 2297, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 5185, 429, 432, 594, 44868, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 2924, 279, 57406, 3082, 7042, 311, 2968, 264, 2664, 2266, 11, 2578, 387, 2163, 220, 16, 17, 3526, 476, 773, 382, 97904, 419, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1855, 264, 4718, 5944, 448, 6894, 369, 8085, 323, 39529, 11, 1817, 8482, 458, 1633, 448, 9760, 3565, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 678, 279, 2567, 5043, 2041, 3259, 279, 4718, 2238, 16965, 382, 14190, 11, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 279, 7042, 5109, 311, 5978, 13403, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 11, 12095, 594, 7042, 374, 911, 220, 17, 13, 16, 22, 3526, 10826, 11, 323, 12831, 279, 57406, 3082, 11, 7196, 220, 16, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 13, 2938, 10362, 911, 1290, 382, 13394, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 3561, 4297, 10277, 304, 4718, 13, 8886, 1376, 1265, 387, 304, 17194, 11, 323, 279, 2750, 1265, 387, 304, 38929, 1283, 23427, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 11, 358, 6099, 429, 594, 2989, 369, 4718, 19482, 13, 97593, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 1431, 382, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 4658, 1101, 3880, 264, 2797, 323, 63594, 4718, 2550, 369, 12313, 476, 17590, 1119, 2441, 1849, 13, 2379, 2578, 537, 614, 5189, 894, 3953, 5043, 11, 773, 18202, 279, 58786, 1265, 76156, 13, 37894, 11, 419, 20027, 862, 3880, 624, 151649, 271, 39814, 0, 5692, 594, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 14873, 788, 341, 262, 330, 61263, 1388, 8726, 2078, 788, 330, 24, 17, 756, 262, 330, 9499, 12679, 915, 788, 330, 44, 35310, 14357, 13769, 68674, 5600, 756, 262, 330, 929, 788, 330, 30552, 62193, 756, 262, 330, 675, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 64574, 788, 330, 71807, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 698, 220, 1153, 220, 330, 53371, 788, 341, 262, 330, 53371, 788, 220, 17, 16, 21, 20, 15, 15, 15, 11, 442, 43819, 3426, 7042, 315, 12095, 198, 262, 330, 34673, 30511, 8726, 53371, 788, 220, 16, 17, 17, 19, 20, 15, 15, 15, 442, 43819, 3426, 57406, 3082, 7042, 198, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '3964e31f832c4af09ee8f4d3b669e1a3', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 529, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.282529830932617, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1769654245.4112456}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to figure out who the user is and what they're using this information for. It could be for a school project, a travel blog, or maybe even a game. The fact that they want it in JSON suggests they're integrating this data into another application or website, so accuracy is key.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should start by identifying the capital of France, which is Paris. That's straightforward. Now, for the population. I know the population of Paris is more than just the city; it includes the entire metropolitan area. I remember that Paris alone has over 12 million people, but the metropolitan area is around 21 million. I should double-check that number to make sure it's up to date. Maybe there have been recent estimates due to COVID or other factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to structure this information in JSON. I'll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"population\" field, and maybe add \"region\" or \" metropolitan area\" if that's relevant. I should present it in a clear and readable format, perhaps using proper capitalization for keys to make it consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also wonder if the user wants any additional information, like the area of the city or some interesting facts. But since they only mentioned population, I'll stick to that. I should make sure the JSON is valid and properly formatted, avoiding any syntax errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is whether the population number is an estimate or exact. I think the latest data might be an approximation because exact numbers can be tricky to come by for such a large urban area. I'll note that it's an approximate figure based on the metropolitan area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll present the JSON in a code block to make it stand out, ensuring readability. I'll keep the explanation concise, just enough to explain the structure without overwhelming the user. I should also make sure the response is helpful and meets the user's needs precisely.\n",
