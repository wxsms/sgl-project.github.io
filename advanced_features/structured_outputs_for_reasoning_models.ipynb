    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

The user asked for the capital and its population in JSON format. I remember that the capital is Paris, so I\\'ll start there.\\n\\nI should check the latest population data. I know that the previous estimates around 2019 were around 12 million. But I\\'m not sure if that\\'s the most recent figure. I should verify that. Maybe I can recall that as of 2023, Paris has a population of about 12.55 million.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into JSON. I\\'ll need a key-value pair with \"Name\" and \"Population.\" The population should be a number. I\\'ll format it as 12550000 to make it clear.\\n\\nI should also consider the date when the population was recorded. If I include today\\'s date, it\\'s October 2023, so that\\'s important for accuracy since populations can fluctuate.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll create a JSON object with the correct structure. I\\'ll make sure the string values are properly quoted and the comma is placed correctly between the key and value.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like age distribution or breakdown, but since they just asked for the population, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe I should confirm that Paris is indeed the capital without doubt, although I know it\\'s definite.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON neatly, making it easy to read. The user is likely looking for a quick and accurate data point, possibly for a project or report, so providing a reliable source like the National Institute of Statistics and Demography would be good, though I didn\\'t specify it in the response.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"Name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": \"12550000\",\\n  \"Date\": \"2023-10-01\"  // This is an example date; population figures can change over time.\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 279, 1196, 594, 3239, 911, 279, 7042, 315, 9625, 594, 6722, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 432, 1495, 13, 576, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 6722, 323, 1181, 7042, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1191, 1052, 382, 40, 1265, 1779, 279, 5535, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 3681, 17530, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 16, 24, 1033, 2163, 220, 16, 17, 3526, 13, 1988, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 421, 429, 594, 279, 1429, 3213, 7071, 13, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 13, 10696, 358, 646, 19091, 429, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 16, 17, 13, 20, 20, 3526, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 4718, 13, 358, 3278, 1184, 264, 1376, 19083, 6716, 448, 330, 675, 1, 323, 330, 53371, 1189, 576, 7042, 1265, 387, 264, 1372, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 432, 438, 220, 16, 17, 20, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 311, 1281, 432, 2797, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 279, 2400, 979, 279, 7042, 572, 12433, 13, 1416, 358, 2924, 3351, 594, 2400, 11, 432, 594, 6527, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 773, 429, 594, 2989, 369, 13403, 2474, 21910, 646, 38288, 6292, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 264, 4718, 1633, 448, 279, 4396, 5944, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 279, 914, 2750, 525, 10277, 23237, 323, 279, 31683, 374, 9099, 12440, 1948, 279, 1376, 323, 897, 382, 40, 5775, 421, 279, 1196, 3880, 803, 3565, 11, 1075, 4231, 7982, 476, 29985, 11, 714, 2474, 807, 1101, 4588, 369, 279, 7042, 11, 358, 3278, 9214, 311, 429, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 7683, 429, 12095, 374, 12824, 279, 6722, 2041, 10492, 11, 7892, 358, 1414, 432, 594, 43770, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 62166, 11, 3259, 432, 4135, 311, 1349, 13, 576, 1196, 374, 4363, 3330, 369, 264, 3974, 323, 13382, 821, 1459, 11, 10767, 369, 264, 2390, 476, 1895, 11, 773, 8241, 264, 14720, 2530, 1075, 279, 5055, 9976, 315, 24624, 323, 4724, 5696, 1035, 387, 1661, 11, 3498, 358, 3207, 944, 13837, 432, 304, 279, 2033, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 675, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 53371, 788, 330, 16, 17, 20, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 756, 220, 330, 1916, 788, 330, 17, 15, 17, 18, 12, 16, 15, 12, 15, 16, 1, 220, 442, 1096, 374, 458, 3110, 2400, 26, 7042, 12396, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 624, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '19b998e2b65942caa95d2a41eec25fd8', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 447, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.8147199153900146, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764310951.0055535}}</strong>"
