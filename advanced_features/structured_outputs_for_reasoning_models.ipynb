    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to figure out how to get the current date and time. The function provided is get_current_date, which requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. That makes sense because it's specific to their location.<br><br>Next, the weather part. The function get_current_weather is available, and it needs a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, but I should also include the state, which is NY. The unit isn't specified, so I'll default to Fahrenheit since that's a common request, but I can note that Celsius is also an option in the response just in case.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll structure the message to ask for both pieces of information using the appropriate function calls. I need to make sure each function call is properly formatted with the required parameters. For the date and time, it's straightforward with the timezone. For the weather, I'll include all three parameters: city, state, and unit.<br><br>I should also remember to add sources where I got the information, but since these are built-in functions, I don't need external data.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '5df5c1288c1e4460819f1a80b122b149', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3462460041046143, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1768422677.8094919}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of France\\'s capital in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to confirm which city is the capital. You know, Paris is the obvious one, but I remember some people might get confused because different countries have different capitals. Just making sure... Yes, Paris is correct.\\n\\nNext, the basics. They want the name of the city, which is straightforward: Paris, France. Then, the population. Hmm, population data can change over time. I think the latest estimate is from 2021, but I should double-check that. From what I recall, Paris has a population around 2.2 million. But wait, maybe it\\'s a bit higher now? Maybe around 2.21 million? I\\'m a bit fuzzy on the exact number, so I should look it up.\\n\\nAlso, the user is asking for this in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, so it\\'s a way to structure data. I remember that in JSON, you use curly braces for objects and square brackets for arrays. Since they\\'re just asking for one data point, an object with a key-value pair should work.\\n\\nAnother thing, the population might be an approximate figure. I should present it that way to avoid giving false information. I don\\'t want to overstate the accuracy here.\\n\\nSo putting it all together: an object with a \"name\" and \"population\" key. The name is \"Paris, Île-de-France.\" I added Île-de-France to clarify it\\'s a region within France. The population, I\\'ll put it as 2.21 million, noting it\\'s an approximate figure.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct—proper commas, no extra spaces, and correct quotation marks.

First, I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. They want a JSON structure, which is a common data format, so I should make sure the response is well-structured.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a given, but just to double-check, I'll confirm that Paris is indeed the administrative capital. Sometimes people confuse it with Lyon, but no, Paris is right. Now, for the population, I need to provide an accurate figure. I recall that Paris has a large population, but it's not static. Demographics change over time due to births, deaths, and migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about the most recent data. I believe the population was around 2.1 million in 2021. But wait, I should check the exact number to make sure. I don't have access to real-time data, but I know that official sources like the INSEE or World Bank usually have the latest stats. For the sake of this response, I'll go with the approximate figure of 2.18 million as of the last update in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, structuring this in JSON. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"capital\" and \"population\". Under \"capital\", I'll put \"Paris\". For \"population\", I'll include both the approximate figure and the exact number for clarity. It's good practice to mention that the population figure is approximate and can change, so the user knows it's an estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the user's possible needs. They might be a student working on a project, a traveler, or someone researching for a report. Either way, providing accurate and clear information is key. Maybe they need this data for a comparison, so highlighting Paris as the largest city in France and the capital is important context.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if they need more details, like the metropolitan area population, but since they didn't specify, I'll stick to the city proper. Also, including the exact population figure in the JSON makes it precise, but adding a note about it being an estimate is good for accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should be simple and easy to understand. I'll make sure the keys are in quotes and the values are correctly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON. Alright, I think that's all. Time to present the answer clearly.\n",
