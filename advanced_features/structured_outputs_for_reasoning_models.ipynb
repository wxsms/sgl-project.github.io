    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not 100% certain. I should double-check that to make sure I provide accurate information.<br><br>I also need to structure this in JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. Maybe \"city\" for the name, \"country\" for the capital, and \"population\" for the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks.<br><br>Wait, the user might be using this data for a project or a presentation. They probably need it in a structured format that's easy to parse. JSON is a good choice because it's widely used in web applications and data interchange. I should ensure the JSON is valid and well-formatted to avoid any issues when they use it.<br><br>I also wonder if they need more details, like the administrative region or some notable landmarks. But since they specifically asked for population, I'll stick to that. Maybe I should include a note about the population figure being approximate, just in case.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll format the JSON with the city name, country, and population. I'll make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. Double-checking the population number is crucial to maintain credibility. I think 2,147,000 is a commonly cited figure, so I'll go with that.<br><br>Finally, I'll present the JSON in a code block so it's easy to read and copy. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data. That way, I cover all bases and ensure the user gets exactly what they're looking for.<br><br><br>content: {<br>  \"name\": \"Paris\",<br>  \"population\": 2147000<br>}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I immediately thought about what the capital is—Paris. Then, I considered the population. I know it's a big city, but I'm not exactly sure of the current number. I remember it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain if it's 3.5 or 3.6. I should double-check that.<br><br>Next, I thought about the structure. The user wants JSON, so I need to format it correctly with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\". I should make sure the syntax is correct—no typos, proper commas, and brackets. <br><br>I also considered the user's possible needs. They might be doing a project or a presentation, so providing accurate data is crucial. Maybe they're a student learning about France's capitals or someone compiling demographic data. Either way, precision is key.<br><br>I decided to look up the latest population figure. A quick search shows that as of 2023, Paris has a population of around 3,600,000. That seems right, but I should note that populations can fluctuate due to births, deaths, and migration. <br><br>Putting it all together, I structured the JSON with the city name, population, and country. I made sure the numbers were accurate and the format was correct. I also added a comment to explain the population figure, just in case the user needed more context.<br><br>Finally, I sent the response, ensuring it was clear and met the user's request.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this query where the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty standard knowledge. So my first task is to determine the population of Paris. I recall that Paris is the most populous city in France, but the exact number isn\\'t something I know off the top of my head. I think it\\'s somewhere in the early to mid-300,000 range, but maybe it\\'s a bit higher now.\\n\\nI should be cautious here because population figures can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. To make this accurate, I might need to check the most recent data. From what I can recall, the population was around 3,069,000 in the 2019 European Union Woods of Europe method and 3,076,000 in the 2022 census. So maybe the number is approximately 3,075,000 people as of the latest data.\\n\\nNow, I need to format this information into a JSON structure. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\\'ll need to include \"City\" as a key with the value \"Paris\" and \"Population\" as another key with the numerical value. I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets, and that the syntax is correct to avoid errors when the JSON is used elsewhere.\\n\\nI should also consider including a source or note about the data being approximate and referencing the latest official sources to ensure credibility. That way, the user knows the information is trustworthy and can look into more recent data if needed.\\n\\nPutting this all together, the JSON would look like this: a dictionary with the keys \"City\" and \"Population\", each holding their respective values. I\\'ll double-check the spelling and correctness of the JSON format to prevent any syntax errors.\\n\\nAdditionally, I should think about why the user is asking this. They might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone planning an event and needs the population number. Regardless, providing accurate and clearly formatted data is essential for their purposes. I don\\'t want to miss anything they might need beyond the population, but the question specifically mentions information and population, so sticking to that should cover their needs.\\n\\nAlright, I think I\\'m ready to put this all together into a clear and concise JSON response.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": 3075000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe population figure provided is an approximation based on recent data. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend consulting official sources such as the latest census or official government publications.', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 419, 3239, 1380, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 3019, 553, 3019, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 5020, 5297, 6540, 13, 2055, 847, 1156, 3383, 374, 311, 8253, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 19091, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 1429, 94451, 3283, 304, 9625, 11, 714, 279, 4734, 1372, 4436, 944, 2494, 358, 1414, 1007, 279, 1909, 315, 847, 1968, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 14696, 304, 279, 4124, 311, 5099, 12, 18, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 2088, 11, 714, 7196, 432, 594, 264, 2699, 5080, 1431, 382, 40, 1265, 387, 45778, 1588, 1576, 7042, 12396, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 4152, 311, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 11906, 13, 2014, 1281, 419, 13382, 11, 358, 2578, 1184, 311, 1779, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 13, 5542, 1128, 358, 646, 19091, 11, 279, 7042, 572, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 15, 21, 24, 11, 15, 15, 15, 304, 279, 220, 17, 15, 16, 24, 7513, 9145, 34748, 315, 4505, 1714, 323, 220, 18, 11, 15, 22, 21, 11, 15, 15, 15, 304, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 17, 43602, 13, 2055, 7196, 279, 1372, 374, 13187, 220, 18, 11, 15, 22, 20, 11, 15, 15, 15, 1251, 438, 315, 279, 5535, 821, 382, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 3561, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 5944, 13, 4718, 7460, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1184, 311, 2924, 330, 12730, 1, 438, 264, 1376, 448, 279, 897, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 330, 53371, 1, 438, 2441, 1376, 448, 279, 34776, 897, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 374, 10277, 23126, 448, 76602, 323, 38929, 11, 323, 429, 279, 19482, 374, 4396, 311, 5648, 5975, 979, 279, 4718, 374, 1483, 17920, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 2670, 264, 2530, 476, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 1660, 44868, 323, 56516, 279, 5535, 3946, 8173, 311, 5978, 37669, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 8788, 279, 1995, 374, 55942, 323, 646, 1401, 1119, 803, 3213, 821, 421, 4362, 382, 97904, 419, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1035, 1401, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 330, 12730, 1, 323, 330, 53371, 497, 1817, 9963, 862, 19511, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1990, 15934, 279, 42429, 323, 57323, 315, 279, 4718, 3561, 311, 5358, 894, 19482, 5975, 382, 49574, 11, 358, 1265, 1744, 911, 3170, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 419, 13, 2379, 2578, 387, 264, 5458, 3238, 389, 264, 2390, 11, 476, 8365, 4325, 9115, 458, 1538, 323, 3880, 279, 7042, 1372, 13, 43740, 11, 8241, 13382, 323, 9355, 23126, 821, 374, 7565, 369, 862, 9895, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1366, 311, 3116, 4113, 807, 2578, 1184, 7797, 279, 7042, 11, 714, 279, 3405, 11689, 33845, 1995, 323, 7042, 11, 773, 36972, 311, 429, 1265, 3421, 862, 3880, 382, 71486, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 2776, 5527, 311, 2182, 419, 678, 3786, 1119, 264, 2797, 323, 63594, 4718, 2033, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 12730, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 53371, 788, 220, 18, 15, 22, 20, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 13874, 19324, 785, 7042, 7071, 3897, 374, 458, 56204, 3118, 389, 3213, 821, 13, 1752, 279, 1429, 13382, 323, 705, 4686, 18413, 1995, 11, 358, 6934, 30731, 3946, 8173, 1741, 438, 279, 5535, 43602, 476, 3946, 3033, 27985, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '6b7b50feac264183b68b4d44a49f5a64', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 580, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.644815444946289, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1765501947.1460586}}</strong>"
