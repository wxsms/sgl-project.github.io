    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I remember it's Paris, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Paris is definitely the capital, no doubt about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find out the population of Paris. Population figures can change over time, so I should look up the most recent estimate. From what I recall, Paris has a population of around 2.2 million people. But I should verify the exact number to ensure accuracy. Let me check some reliable sources or maybe even the latest census data to confirm this figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants the information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data in a readable format. I need to create an object that includes both the capital's name and its population. So, I'll set up a JSON object with a key for \"capital\" and another for \"population\", each containing their respective values.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes around the keys and string values, and proper commas and brackets. It's important to avoid any syntax errors so that the JSON remains valid and can be parsed correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I should consider the user's possible intent. They might be looking for a quick fact check, possibly for a project, report, or personal knowledge. By providing the information in a structured format like JSON, it might be easier for them to integrate this data into another application or use it programmatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if there's a preferred way the user wants the population number presented. Should it be a rounded figure or the exact current number? Since population data can vary depending on the source and the time of year, I'll go with the most recent and reliable figure available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should present the information clearly, making sure that the JSON is properly formatted without any errors. This will help the user understand and use the data without confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, my steps are: identify the capital, find the latest population number, structure it into a JSON object, and ensure the syntax is correct. This should provide the user with a clear and accurate answer in the format they requested.\n",
