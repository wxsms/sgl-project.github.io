    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York and the weather there. I remember the user mentioned using specific functions, so I should probably use the ones they provided.<br><br>First, for the date and time, I think I need to use the 'get_current_date' function. The function requires a timezone parameter. The user mentioned New York, so I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. That makes sense because it's a common timezone for New York.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I believe I need to use the 'get_current_weather' function. This function needs a city and a state. Since the user is in New York, the city is 'New York' and the state is 'NY'. That should cover it.<br><br>I should make sure to call these functions one after the other. So first, I'll call get_current_date with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. Then, I'll call get_current_weather with city as 'New York' and state as 'NY'. <br><br>Wait, I should check if the functions require any other parameters. The 'get_current_date' function only needs the timezone, and 'get_current_weather' requires city, state, and unit. Oh, right, the unit is optional, but since the user didn't specify, maybe I should default it to Celsius or Fahrenheit. But since the weather could be in either, perhaps I should include both options. Or maybe the function can handle it if I set it to 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'. I think the function allows specifying the unit, so I should include it in the parameters.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll structure the function calls in the specified format, making sure to include all necessary parameters. I should also add the sources where I got the information from, which are the function descriptions provided by the user.<br><br>So, the final response should have two function calls: one for the date and time with the correct timezone, and another for the weather with the city and state, along with the unit. I need to make sure each function call is on its own line and follows the exact format the user outlined.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out the capital of France and provide its population in JSON format. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital city of France, but I\\'m not exactly sure about its current population. I remember that major cities in Europe have been growing and shrinking over the years due to various factors like economic changes, population migration, and urban development.\\n\\nI think the population might be around the hundreds of millions. Wait, no, that\\'s too high. I believe Paris is one of the larger cities in Europe, but not the largest. Maybe it\\'s in the 20 to 30 million range? I\\'m a bit confused because some other big cities in Europe, like Berlin or Madrid, have populations similar to Paris but maybe a bit lower or higher? Or maybe not—I should probably check.\\n\\nI recall that in recent years, Paris has had some challenges with overcrowding, especially in the city center. But I\\'m not sure if that means the population has increased or decreased. Maybe I should think about how population data is usually presented. It\\'s often rounded to the nearest thousand or ten thousand to make it easier to read.\\n\\nLooking at other capital cities, for example, the capitals of other countries: London has a population in the tens of millions, but I think it\\'s more than Paris. Tokyo also comes to mind, but I think its population is significantly higher, maybe in the 30 million or even higher range, while Paris is more in the 20 million.\\n\\nI should also consider the time frame. Population data can change, so it\\'s important to note that it might be an approximate figure. Maybe the current population is about 21 million. That seems familiar from some recent articles I\\'ve read.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the capital of France is Paris, and its population is approximately 21.3 million. I think that\\'s a reasonable estimate, considering factors like urbanization and migration trends. I should present this information in JSON format as the user requested. So, the JSON would include the key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and the key \"population\" with the value of 21.3.\\n\\nWait, but I\\'m not 100% certain about the exact number. Maybe it\\'s slightly different now. I should double-check that information if possible, but since I can\\'t access the internet, I\\'ll stick with the figure I have. It\\'s important to provide accurate data, so I\\'ll proceed with 21.3 million as the population.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 21300000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object provides the capital city of France as \"Paris\" and its population as approximately 21,300,000.', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 323, 3410, 1181, 7042, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 1077, 752, 1191, 553, 88646, 1128, 358, 1414, 911, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 911, 1181, 1482, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 3598, 9720, 304, 4505, 614, 1012, 7826, 323, 62085, 916, 279, 1635, 4152, 311, 5257, 9363, 1075, 6955, 4344, 11, 7042, 11906, 11, 323, 15662, 4401, 382, 40, 1744, 279, 7042, 2578, 387, 2163, 279, 11499, 315, 11728, 13, 13824, 11, 902, 11, 429, 594, 2238, 1550, 13, 358, 4411, 12095, 374, 825, 315, 279, 8131, 9720, 304, 4505, 11, 714, 537, 279, 7772, 13, 10696, 432, 594, 304, 279, 220, 17, 15, 311, 220, 18, 15, 3526, 2088, 30, 358, 2776, 264, 2699, 21815, 1576, 1045, 1008, 2409, 9720, 304, 4505, 11, 1075, 19846, 476, 24081, 11, 614, 21910, 4428, 311, 12095, 714, 7196, 264, 2699, 4722, 476, 5080, 30, 2521, 7196, 537, 50657, 1265, 4658, 1779, 382, 40, 19091, 429, 304, 3213, 1635, 11, 12095, 702, 1030, 1045, 11513, 448, 87104, 6968, 11, 5310, 304, 279, 3283, 4126, 13, 1988, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 421, 429, 3363, 279, 7042, 702, 7172, 476, 24938, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1744, 911, 1246, 7042, 821, 374, 5990, 10449, 13, 1084, 594, 3545, 17976, 311, 279, 23480, 16183, 476, 5779, 16183, 311, 1281, 432, 8661, 311, 1349, 382, 22464, 518, 1008, 6722, 9720, 11, 369, 3110, 11, 279, 92999, 315, 1008, 5837, 25, 7148, 702, 264, 7042, 304, 279, 22008, 315, 11728, 11, 714, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 803, 1091, 12095, 13, 26194, 1083, 4041, 311, 3971, 11, 714, 358, 1744, 1181, 7042, 374, 11941, 5080, 11, 7196, 304, 279, 220, 18, 15, 3526, 476, 1496, 5080, 2088, 11, 1393, 12095, 374, 803, 304, 279, 220, 17, 15, 3526, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 279, 882, 4034, 13, 39529, 821, 646, 2297, 11, 773, 432, 594, 2989, 311, 5185, 429, 432, 2578, 387, 458, 44868, 7071, 13, 10696, 279, 1482, 7042, 374, 911, 220, 17, 16, 3526, 13, 2938, 4977, 11285, 504, 1045, 3213, 9709, 358, 3003, 1349, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 323, 1181, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 17, 16, 13, 18, 3526, 13, 358, 1744, 429, 594, 264, 13276, 16045, 11, 12831, 9363, 1075, 15662, 2022, 323, 11906, 18339, 13, 358, 1265, 3042, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 438, 279, 1196, 11223, 13, 2055, 11, 279, 4718, 1035, 2924, 279, 1376, 330, 65063, 1, 448, 279, 897, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 279, 1376, 330, 44441, 1, 448, 279, 897, 315, 220, 17, 16, 13, 18, 382, 14190, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 220, 16, 15, 15, 4, 3654, 911, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 432, 594, 10078, 2155, 1431, 13, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 1995, 421, 3204, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 646, 944, 2615, 279, 7602, 11, 358, 3278, 9214, 448, 279, 7071, 358, 614, 13, 1084, 594, 2989, 311, 3410, 13382, 821, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 10354, 448, 220, 17, 16, 13, 18, 3526, 438, 279, 7042, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 18, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 1633, 5707, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 438, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 1181, 7042, 438, 13187, 220, 17, 16, 11, 18, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '4560ce20d1984d19988e32d9ba52232e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 600, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.811399459838867, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766975229.7368786}}</strong>"

      "Next, they want the population. I remember that Paris is a big city, so the population is in the millions. I think it's around 2 million. But wait, I should double-check. I recall that the population was around 2.1 million a few years back. Maybe it's a bit higher now, like 2.2 million? I'll go with 2.2 million to be accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to present this information in JSON format. JSON uses key-value pairs, so I'll have a main key, maybe \"capital_info\", which contains two key-value pairs: \"name\" and \"population\". The name would be \"Paris\" and the population would be 2.2 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the numbers are correct and the format is properly structured. Also, since the user asked for JSON, I need to ensure there are no markdown elements and it's just plain JSON.\n",

      "}\n",
      "\n",
