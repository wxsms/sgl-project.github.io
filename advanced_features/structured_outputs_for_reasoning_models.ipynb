    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'c9508ee1c82d4601beb74dd35453f97f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.322984457015991, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1767245527.730422}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out the population of the capital of France. Hmm, I know the capital of France is Paris, but I\\'m not exactly sure about its current population. I think it\\'s a big city, but how many people live there? I remember people saying it\\'s over 30 million, but I\\'m not 100% sure. Maybe I should check some reliable sources or recent statistics. \\n\\nWait, I recall that Paris has a metropolitan area, and sometimes when they talk about the population, they include the entire metro area. I think the metro area population is around 13 million, but that doesn\\'t seem right. No, wait, that\\'s too low. No, actually, the metropolitan area population is about 12.5 million, which includes all the surrounding towns and suburbs. \\n\\nBut the question is about the capital, so I think it refers specifically to the administrative center, not the entire metro area. So, the population might be higher than that. If the metro area is 12.5 million, the city proper, including the Seine River area, might be a bit more. I think it\\'s around 8.5 million. But I might be confusing it with another city. \\n\\nLet me think, Paris is one of the largest cities in Europe, so it must have a significant population. I\\'ve heard that it\\'s larger than many other cities in the world. Maybe over 3 million? That can\\'t be right because the metro area is already 12 million. So probably, the capital itself is around 8.5 to 10 million. \\n\\nI don\\'t have exact numbers on hand, so I should look it up to be sure. But since I can\\'t access the internet right now, I\\'ll have to make an educated guess based on what I remember.

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward. Now, they want the population, so I need to recall or look up the most recent data. I remember that Paris has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. I think it's over 3 million, maybe 3.5 or 3.6 million? But I should verify that to be accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the user specified JSON format. I'm a bit new to this, but I know JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data. So I need to format the information about Paris into a JSON object. I should include the city name, its administrative region, the population, and perhaps a note about the population figure being approximate since it can change.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using curly braces, commas appropriately, and proper quotation marks. Also, the key names should be in English, like \"CityName\", \"AdministrativeRegion\", and \"Population\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should double-check the population number. Maybe I can recall that in recent years, Paris has grown a bit, so perhaps it's around 3,500,000 people as of 2023. I should mention that the figure might be approximate because population statistics can fluctuate based on various factors like real estate development, migration, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON object should have three keys: the city name, administrative region, and population. I'll structure it neatly, making sure each key is in quotes and the values are correctly placed. I'll also add a comment or note that the population is approximate to be transparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers everything the user asked for. They wanted the information in JSON, so I provided that with the necessary details. I hope this meets their needs and is accurate enough.\n",
