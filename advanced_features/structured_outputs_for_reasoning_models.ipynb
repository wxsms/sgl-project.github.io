    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user just asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s a fact, but I should double-check to make sure I\\'m correct. Yes, Paris is definitely the administrative capital, but the political capital might be different, but I think in this context, they just want the administrative one.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I vaguely remember that Paris has a large population, maybe around 2 million. But I think it\\'s more than that. Let me recall; I think it\\'s approximately 2.17 million as of 2023. I should verify this because population numbers can change over time. Maybe I can look it up or refer to recent data from the official sources like INSEE or World Population Review. Wait, I shouldn\\'t actually look it up myself but rather use my existing knowledge.\\n\\nSo, population is about 2,170,000. That seems right. But I also remember that Paris has grown quite a bit in recent decades due to吸引ing immigrants and students from other countries. I should include any relevant information like the fastest-growing city in Europe or something like that. That adds context and makes the information more useful.\\n\\nPutting it together, the JSON structure should have a key like \"capital\" with the name \"Paris\", another key with the population, maybe \"population\" as 2170000, and an additional key \"Trivia\" with some fun facts. That way, it\\'s informative and engaging.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper quotation marks and commas. No trailing commas, so each key is correctly separated. Let me format it correctly. So the JSON would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2170000,\\n  \"Trivia\": \"Did you know that Paris is the most populated city in France and the second most in the European Union?\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, does that make sense? Trivia-wise, Paris is indeed the most populated city in France, and as the second in the EU, since London is first. So that\\'s accurate. I think that covers all the user\\'s requirements. They asked for the information and population in JSON, so this should be sufficient. I should also consider if there\\'s any more recent data, but given that I don\\'t have access to the internet, sticking with recent numbers from 2023 should be fine.\\n\\nI wonder, could there be any other fields the user might find useful? Maybe area or history, but the question specifically asked for population. So I\\'ll stick to the three fields mentioned. That should be clear and concise for the user.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2170000,\\n  \"Trivia\": \"Did you know that Paris is the most populated city in France and the second most populated city in the European Union?\"\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 1101, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 264, 2097, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 311, 1281, 2704, 358, 2776, 4396, 13, 7414, 11, 12095, 374, 8491, 279, 22707, 6722, 11, 714, 279, 4948, 6722, 2578, 387, 2155, 11, 714, 358, 1744, 304, 419, 2266, 11, 807, 1101, 1366, 279, 22707, 825, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 71959, 6099, 429, 12095, 702, 264, 3460, 7042, 11, 7196, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 13, 1988, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 803, 1091, 429, 13, 6771, 752, 19091, 26, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 13187, 220, 17, 13, 16, 22, 3526, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 358, 1265, 10146, 419, 1576, 7042, 5109, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 13, 10696, 358, 646, 1401, 432, 705, 476, 8300, 311, 3213, 821, 504, 279, 3946, 8173, 1075, 1964, 48740, 476, 4337, 39529, 10294, 13, 13824, 11, 358, 13133, 944, 3520, 1401, 432, 705, 7037, 714, 4751, 990, 847, 6350, 6540, 382, 4416, 11, 7042, 374, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 1290, 13, 1988, 358, 1083, 6099, 429, 12095, 702, 14700, 5008, 264, 2699, 304, 3213, 10793, 4152, 311, 100765, 287, 19955, 323, 4143, 504, 1008, 5837, 13, 358, 1265, 2924, 894, 9760, 1995, 1075, 279, 25648, 55557, 3283, 304, 4505, 476, 2494, 1075, 429, 13, 2938, 11367, 2266, 323, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 5390, 382, 97904, 432, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1265, 614, 264, 1376, 1075, 330, 65063, 1, 448, 279, 829, 330, 59604, 497, 2441, 1376, 448, 279, 7042, 11, 7196, 330, 44441, 1, 438, 220, 17, 16, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 458, 5107, 1376, 330, 55006, 1, 448, 1045, 2464, 13064, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 432, 594, 38219, 323, 22570, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 11, 448, 6169, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 11, 773, 1817, 1376, 374, 12440, 18663, 13, 6771, 752, 3561, 432, 12440, 13, 2055, 279, 4718, 1035, 387, 1447, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 55006, 788, 330, 6986, 498, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 1429, 34359, 3283, 304, 9625, 323, 279, 2086, 1429, 304, 279, 7513, 9145, 47369, 630, 14190, 11, 1558, 429, 1281, 5530, 30, 1163, 20809, 44439, 11, 12095, 374, 12824, 279, 1429, 34359, 3283, 304, 9625, 11, 323, 438, 279, 2086, 304, 279, 9812, 11, 2474, 7148, 374, 1156, 13, 2055, 429, 594, 13382, 13, 358, 1744, 429, 14521, 678, 279, 1196, 594, 8502, 13, 2379, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 387, 14016, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 2908, 421, 1052, 594, 894, 803, 3213, 821, 11, 714, 2661, 429, 358, 1513, 944, 614, 2615, 311, 279, 7602, 11, 36972, 448, 3213, 5109, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 1265, 387, 6915, 382, 40, 5775, 11, 1410, 1052, 387, 894, 1008, 5043, 279, 1196, 2578, 1477, 5390, 30, 10696, 3082, 476, 3840, 11, 714, 279, 3405, 11689, 4588, 369, 7042, 13, 2055, 358, 3278, 9214, 311, 279, 2326, 5043, 9733, 13, 2938, 1265, 387, 2797, 323, 63594, 369, 279, 1196, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 55006, 788, 330, 6986, 498, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 1429, 34359, 3283, 304, 9625, 323, 279, 2086, 1429, 34359, 3283, 304, 279, 7513, 9145, 47369, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'cee564fd696f46f7a1e64f647cd149fe', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 629, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.8803586959838867, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1769417704.59963}}</strong>"

      "Now, the user specifically asked for the population. I'm not exactly sure of the current number, but I remember it's around 2 million. I should probably double-check that, but since I can't access real-time data, I'll go with the commonly cited figure. \n",
      "\n",
      "They also mentioned JSON format, so I need to structure the response correctly. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll include \"country\" as the key and \"Paris\" as the value. Then, another key for population with the number 2,000,000. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with quotes and commas in the right places. Maybe adding line breaks for readability would help. The user didn't specify if they want the population as an integer or a string, but since it's a number, it makes sense to present it as an integer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to provide a helpful context or description. The user might want to know why Paris is the capital or why it's important to know its population. So, I'll add a sentence explaining that Paris is the political and cultural center of France, and its population is a significant figure in urban studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the keys, insert the values, and add a brief description to make the response informative. I should also ensure that the JSON syntax is correct to avoid any errors when the user tries to parse it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I mention the units for the population? Probably not necessary in JSON, but including it could make the response clearer. Alternatively, I could just use the number without units since it's standard knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, considering the user's possible intent, they might be using this data for a project or presentation. So, accuracy is key. I'll stick with the commonly accepted figure unless I have reason to believe it's outdated, which I don't at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
