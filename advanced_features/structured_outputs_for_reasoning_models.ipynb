    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '852380ed69744cc7a6efbf87da55bbe9', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.4292891025543213, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766435854.8893754}}</strong>"

First, I should determine what the capital of France is. From what I remember, the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s right, Paris is the official seat of government, administrative center, and a major cultural and economic hub.\\n\\nNow, I need to find out the current population of Paris. I know that populations can change over time, so I should look for the most recent data. I think the population figures are approximate because exact numbers might not be easily accessible, especially if it\\'s an ongoing estimate.\\n\\nI remember that major cities in France have population figures in the millions. For example, Paris is one of the largest cities in Europe, so its population is sizable. I\\'ve heard the number around 2 million, but I\\'m not entirely sure if that\\'s accurate. Maybe it\\'s a bit more or less? I should verify that.\\n\\nWait, I think the population is around 2.1 million. I recall reading it somewhere, but I\\'m not 100% confident. To be safe, I should consider using a ballpark figure rather than trying to get an exact number. Sometimes, official sources might not provide precise data, especially in real-time.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m going to go with an estimated population of 2.1 million for Paris. Now, I need to structure this information in JSON format. JSON format requires key-value pairs, where the key is the country\\'s capital and the value is the population number. Since the population is an approximate value, I\\'ll denote that by adding the word \"approx\" next to the number.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have a key \"capital\" with the value being \"Paris,\" a key \"population\" with the value being \"2.1 approx million.\" I\\'ll make sure to format it correctly with proper syntax, including commas and quotation marks where necessary.\\n\\nJust to recap, the steps were:\\n1.

      "\n",
      "First, I know the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward. Now, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is the most populous city in France, but I'm not exactly sure about the current population number. I think it's around 2 million, but I should verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, population figures can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. I should check the latest available data. Maybe the user is looking for an approximate figure since exact numbers might be too recent or not widely available.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall that Paris has a large number of people, so 2 million seems about right. But I'm a bit uncertain because I know the population can vary each year. To be accurate, I should present it as an approximate figure, maybe with a note that it's current as of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the user wants the information in JSON format. I need to structure this properly. The JSON should have a key for the city and another for the population. Including a timestamp might be helpful to indicate when the data was last updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is correctly formatted without any syntax errors. Using proper braces and quotes is essential. Maybe I'll write it like this: {\"City\": \"Paris\", \"Population\": \"20230000\", \"Year\": \"2023\"}. That way, it's clear and easy to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if the user needs more details, like area or other statistics, but since they specifically asked for population, I'll stick to that. Keeping it simple and to the point is probably best here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I'll double-check the population number to ensure accuracy. I think the figure I have is correct, but it's always good to be cautious about the source. If the user needs the most recent data, they might have to check a reliable government or statistical database.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the city name, approximate population, and the year, keeping it concise and accurate.\n",
