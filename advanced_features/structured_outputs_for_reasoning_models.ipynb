    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I think the population has been increasing over the years, so perhaps it's now over 3.5 million? I'm a bit confused because sometimes I hear different numbers, so I should make sure. Maybe I can recall that Paris has a metropolitan area that's much larger, but the city proper is around 3.5 million. I think I'll go with that for now.<br><br><br>content: Paris is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user is asking for the capital of France and its population in JSON format. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the capital. France is a country I\\'m somewhat familiar with, but I should double-check its capital to be sure. Paris is the capital, right? Yeah, that\\'s correct. It\\'s the largest city in the country and the political center.\\n\\nNow, the user wants the population. I\\'m not exactly sure about the latest figures, so I should look that up. I recall that Paris is a big city, so its population is in the millions. The exact number might have changed, but I think it\\'s around 2 million people. Wait, no, that seems too low. Let me think again. Maybe I mixed it up with another city. No, I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s over 2 million. Maybe 2.2 million? Or is it more? Hmm, perhaps it\\'s 3.5 million. Wait, that sounds more accurate. I think the population has grown over the years, especially with tourism and moving to the city for work or studies.\\n\\nOkay, so putting it all together, I need to present this information in JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll structure it with \"capital\" and \"population\" as keys. Since population is a number, I\\'ll represent it as an integer.\\n\\nI should also make sure the JSON syntax is correct. I\\'ll use double quotes for the keys and string values, and commas appropriately between the key-value pairs. No trailing commas are allowed, so I need to be careful with that.\\n\\nWait, the user didn\\'t specify whether they need the population number precise or just an approximate value. Given that I don\\'t have access to real-time data, providing an approximate figure is acceptable. So I\\'ll go with the estimate of 2,199,265 as of 2023, which I remember from previous knowledge.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look like this: a dictionary with the two keys and their corresponding values. No additional text or explanations, just the JSON structure. The user wanted the information in JSON, so this format meets their requirement.\\n\\nI should also make sure that the JSON is valid. Typically, brackets are used to denote objects in JSON, so I\\'ll put the key-value pairs inside square brackets. Each key and value separated by a comma, except for the last one.\\n\\nDouble-checking, the capital is Paris, and the population is approximately 2.199 million. I think that\\'s correct, but it\\'s always good to verify sources. However, since I can\\'t access the internet, I\\'ll stick with my memory for now.\\n\\nSo, the final JSON should be straightforward without any extra information or explanations. Just the data structure they asked for.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2199265\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 323, 1181, 7042, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 6722, 13, 9625, 374, 264, 3146, 358, 2776, 14400, 11285, 448, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 1181, 6722, 311, 387, 2704, 13, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 1290, 30, 21607, 11, 429, 594, 4396, 13, 1084, 594, 279, 7772, 3283, 304, 279, 3146, 323, 279, 4948, 4126, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 1196, 6801, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 911, 279, 5535, 12396, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1401, 429, 705, 13, 358, 19091, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 2409, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 304, 279, 11728, 13, 576, 4734, 1372, 2578, 614, 5497, 11, 714, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 1251, 13, 13824, 11, 902, 11, 429, 4977, 2238, 3347, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 1549, 13, 10696, 358, 9519, 432, 705, 448, 2441, 3283, 13, 2308, 11, 358, 2776, 5020, 2704, 432, 594, 916, 220, 17, 3526, 13, 10696, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 30, 2521, 374, 432, 803, 30, 88190, 11, 8365, 432, 594, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 13, 13824, 11, 429, 10362, 803, 13382, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 7042, 702, 14700, 916, 279, 1635, 11, 5310, 448, 30983, 323, 7218, 311, 279, 3283, 369, 975, 476, 7822, 382, 32313, 11, 773, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 5944, 432, 448, 330, 65063, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 1, 438, 6894, 13, 8704, 7042, 374, 264, 1372, 11, 358, 3278, 4009, 432, 438, 458, 7546, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 13, 358, 3278, 990, 1990, 17194, 369, 279, 6894, 323, 914, 2750, 11, 323, 76602, 34901, 1948, 279, 1376, 19083, 13530, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 525, 5420, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 387, 16585, 448, 429, 382, 14190, 11, 279, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 3425, 807, 1184, 279, 7042, 1372, 23560, 476, 1101, 458, 44868, 897, 13, 16246, 429, 358, 1513, 944, 614, 2615, 311, 1931, 7246, 821, 11, 8241, 458, 44868, 7071, 374, 21555, 13, 2055, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 279, 16045, 315, 220, 17, 11, 16, 24, 24, 11, 17, 21, 20, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 892, 358, 6099, 504, 3681, 6540, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 1378, 6894, 323, 862, 12159, 2750, 13, 2308, 5107, 1467, 476, 40841, 11, 1101, 279, 4718, 5944, 13, 576, 1196, 4829, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 3561, 20027, 862, 16287, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 1281, 2704, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 13, 45302, 11, 38929, 525, 1483, 311, 78064, 6171, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 2182, 279, 1376, 19083, 13530, 4766, 9334, 38929, 13, 8886, 1376, 323, 897, 18663, 553, 264, 31683, 11, 3650, 369, 279, 1537, 825, 382, 7378, 15934, 287, 11, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 323, 279, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 17, 13, 16, 24, 24, 3526, 13, 358, 1744, 429, 594, 4396, 11, 714, 432, 594, 2677, 1661, 311, 10146, 8173, 13, 4354, 11, 2474, 358, 646, 944, 2615, 279, 7602, 11, 358, 3278, 9214, 448, 847, 4938, 369, 1431, 382, 4416, 11, 279, 1590, 4718, 1265, 387, 30339, 2041, 894, 4960, 1995, 476, 40841, 13, 4599, 279, 821, 5944, 807, 4588, 369, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 24, 24, 17, 21, 20, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '435f795b98b24232b9a387cb59bada27', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 611, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'cached_tokens_details': None, 'e2e_latency': 4.941817998886108, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1770651861.553003}}</strong>"
