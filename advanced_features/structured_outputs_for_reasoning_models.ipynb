    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'af34418fef67411a9f652e563b97607b', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'queue_time': 0.00020103901624679565, 'prefill_delay': 0.00045301509089767933, 'prefill_latency': 0.010224357945844531, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.409233570098877, 'request_received_ts': 1762485620.957244, 'request_scheduled_ts': 1762485620.9576705, 'decode_finished_ts': 1762485623.3664775, 'forward_time': 2.4081978930626065, 'response_sent_ts': 1762485623.3665335}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I just got a query where the user says, \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" Hmm, I need to figure out how to respond to this properly.\\n\\nFirst off, the user is asking for a JSON format, which is a specific data structure. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\\'s commonly used for data exchange. So I need to structure the information about the capital of France into a JSON object.\\n\\nWait, the user mentioned both \"information\" and \"population.\" I should be clear about what exactly they\\'re asking for. Information about the capital could include its name, location, and maybe some history or notable landmarks. But population data, especially since it can change over time, is something else, possibly with some statistical metrics.\\n\\nThe capital of France is Paris. So the basic info is Paris, France. But to make it comprehensive, I should include more details. Let\\'s think: Paris is known for the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, and of course, its status as the political and cultural center of France. Also, mentioning its diversity in diplomacy, arts, and sciences might be good.\\n\\nNow, regarding the population. I know that Paris is one of the largest cities in the world, but its population density is incredibly high. I believe the population figure is around 2 million people, but that\\'s just the urban area. The city has grown over the years, so maybe I should note that the data can change. Including an approximate population and some details about its demographic makeup might be helpful. Maybe 2 million as the urban population, perhaps around 7 million in the metropolitan area, but I need to verify that.\\n\\nI should structure this into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I can create a \"Paris\" object with properties like \"country,\" \"city,\" \"population_urban,\" \"population_total,\" \"average_age,\" and \" notable_institutions.\" Each of these will hold relevant data.\\n\\nWait, I should check the population figures to make sure they\\'re accurate. Let me think: as of recent data, Paris\\'s urban population is about 2,150,000. The metropolitan area is around 8,500,000. But these numbers can fluctuate, so including an approximate population with a note about potential changes is advisable.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll create a JSON object with the necessary fields. I\\'ll make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Also, using capital letters for keys is standard in JSON, so that\\'s taken care of.\\n\\nI should make sure the response is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary jargon but still providing enough information. The user might be looking for data to present or integrate into another project, so presenting it in a structured format like JSON would be helpful for their needs.\\n\\nI should double-check the population numbers to ensure accuracy. Maybe look at recent census data or official statistics to confirm the current figures. This step is crucial to provide reliable information, which is important for the user\\'s needs.\\n\\nAdditionally, considering the user input, perhaps they\\'re conducting research, preparing a presentation, or working on a project that requires population data. Providing both historical and current relevant data points could add more value to their work.\\n\\nIn summary, I\\'ll structure the JSON to include key pieces of information about Paris, the population figures, and any additional relevant details to make the response informative and useful. Making sure the JSON is correctly formatted and the data is up to date is essential for the user\\'s satisfaction and the utility of the response.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a fact, but I should double-check to make sure. Paris is indeed the administrative capital, and sometimes political capitals can vary, but I think in France, it's Paris all the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need the population. I remember that Paris is a very large city, one of the biggest in the world. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. I should look up the latest data to get the accurate figure. Maybe around 2,100,000? That sounds familiar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. So, I need to format this as a JSON object. I'll need a key for the city name and another for the population. \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure would have a key like \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key like \"population\" with the number. I should make sure the syntax is correct—commas in the right places, quotation marks around the strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if the user might need the population figure in a different format, maybe with commas for thousands separators. But since they didn't specify, I'll keep it as a plain number. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, is the population figure up to date? I should confirm the latest estimate. Maybe I'm recalling it from a few years ago. Let me think... I believe it's around 2,165,000 as of 2023. That's the most recent number I can remember. I'll use that to make sure the data is current.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final JSON should look like this: a dictionary with two keys, one for the city and one for the population. I'll format it neatly with proper indentation for readability. That way, the user can easily see the information without any confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's it. I'll present the JSON and mention that the population figure is approximate to cover any uncertainties. This way, the user knows there might be slight variations depending on the source. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just to double-check everything: capital is Paris, population around 2.165 million, and the JSON is correctly formatted. Yep, that should do it.\n",
