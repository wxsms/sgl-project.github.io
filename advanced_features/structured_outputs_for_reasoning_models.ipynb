    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '85e06562c7cc4ba4a9e34590a81a652e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'cached_tokens_details': None, 'e2e_latency': 3.851245641708374, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1770955314.393266}}\n"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user asked me for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to Figure out what exactly they\\'re asking for. The capital of France is Paris, that\\'s clear. So, I should gather the population data for Paris.\\n\\nI remember that population figures can change over time, so they might want the most recent numbers. The 2020 data usually comes to mind because it\\'s a recent estimate. Paris\\'s population in 2020 was around 2,165,000. I should check that to make sure it\\'s accurate.\\n\\nOkay, so the main points to include are the city name, country, population, and approximately the year. I should structure this in a JSON format, which is key for the user\\'s request. They mentioned they prefer JSON, so I need to present the information neatly within that structure.\\n\\nI should also think about the formatting. Each key in the JSON should be descriptive, like \"CityName,\" \"CountryName,\" \"Population,\" and \"Year.\" This makes it clear and easy to read. Also, making sure the population number is correctly formatted, either as a number or a string within the JSON.\\n\\nWait, do I need to include the units? Well, in the example I provided earlier, it just says \"2165000\" without specifying units. I think that’s okay because it\\'s implicitly understood as people. So I’ll stick with that.\\n\\nIs there anything else the user might need? They might want to know the exact number, so accuracy is important here. I should double-check the population figure to ensure it\\'s up-to-date and correct.\\n\\nAlso, maybe they want more details, like area or density, but they didn\\'t ask for it.

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to figure out what exactly they need. The capital of France is Paris, so that's straightforward. I should gather the population data, but I'm not sure about the current numbers. I remember that population figures can change every year, so I should look up the latest data to make sure it's accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the population figure I have is around 2.1 million, but I'm not 100% sure if that's the most recent number. Maybe I should check a reliable source to confirm. Also, besides the population, I should include some key information about Paris to provide a comprehensive answer. That might include its historical significance, the Eiffel Tower, its role as a cultural and economic hub, and maybe some notable landmarks or events associated with the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, putting this into JSON format. I know JSON uses key-value pairs, so I'll structure it with \"City\" as one key, and under that, include \"Name\" for the capital and \"Population\" for the figure. Then, under \"Info,\" I'll list the key points about Paris. I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets in the right places to avoid errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to consider if the user might need this information for a specific purpose, like a school project or a presentation. Providing accurate and up-to-date information is crucial. If the population figure is outdated, the user might have trouble with their work. So, I'll double-check the population number to ensure it's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I should present the information clearly, making sure the JSON is valid and easy to read. Maybe I'll separate the population into two lines for better readability, even though in JSON it's not necessary. But as a user, that might make it easier to copy or use in another application.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the user is aware that population figures can fluctuate due to various factors like births, deaths, and migration. It might be helpful to mention that the number can change over time. Also, providing historical context about Paris could add depth to the response, making it more informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is the format of the response. The user asked for JSON, so I should stick to that but also offer other formats like plain text or markdown if they're interested. That way, I'm being helpful and accommodating to different needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I should make sure the response is concise but comprehensive. The user didn't specify how detailed they want the information, but including both the population and some key facts about the city should cover their needs. I'll structure it clearly so it's easy to read and understand.\n",
