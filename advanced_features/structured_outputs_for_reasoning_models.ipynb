    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

They mentioned using functions to get this information, so I need to figure out which functions to use and how to structure the response.<br><br>First, I should determine which function to use for the date and time. The available function is get_current_date, which requires a timezone parameter. New York is in the 'America/New_York' timezone, so I'll need to pass that in the parameters.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the user didn't specify a particular city, but they're in New York, so I'll assume they want the weather for their current location. Therefore, I'll use get_current_weather with the city as 'New York' and the unit as 'fahrenheit' since the user didn't specify otherwise.<br><br>Now, I'll structure the responses.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '1d5153d9342e4512888e37e0db90578c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.464484691619873, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764037501.3690774}}</strong>"

First, I need to identify the capital of France, which is Paris. \\n\\nNext, I should gather the necessary details about Paris. I recall that Paris is a major city known for its rich history and cultural significance. It\\'s the political and cultural center of France. \\n\\nNow, focusing on the population: I think around the 2020 estimates, Paris had a population of approximately 2.16 million. I should check if that\\'s the latest available data. I don\\'t have access to current databases here, but 2.16 million rings a bell as a recent figure.\\n\\nTo present this in JSON, I need to structure it properly. The keys should be \"city\" and \"population\". The population should be an integer since it\\'s a count. I\\'ll format it as { \"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2160000 } to keep it clean and straightforward.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper quotes and commas. Also, since the user mentioned JSON, they might be using it for data processing or integration, so accuracy is key. \\n\\nI don\\'t think the user wants additional information, just the facts in the specified format. They might be checking this for a project or report, so providing precise and concise data is important.\\n\\nWait, I should confirm the latest population figure. Just to be sure, I\\'ll mention that this is based on estimates around 2020. That way, the user knows the number is approximate and might be used for reference purposes.\\n\\nOkay, I think I\\'ve covered everything the user needs. Time to put it all together in the JSON format as requested.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2160000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 9625, 594, 6722, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 11, 892, 374, 12095, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1265, 9567, 279, 5871, 3565, 911, 12095, 13, 358, 19091, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 3881, 369, 1181, 9080, 3840, 323, 12752, 25361, 13, 1084, 594, 279, 4948, 323, 12752, 4126, 315, 9625, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 21080, 389, 279, 7042, 25, 358, 1744, 2163, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 17530, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 17, 13, 16, 21, 3526, 13, 358, 1265, 1779, 421, 429, 594, 279, 5535, 2500, 821, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 614, 2615, 311, 1482, 31806, 1588, 11, 714, 220, 17, 13, 16, 21, 3526, 24544, 264, 28419, 438, 264, 3213, 7071, 382, 1249, 3042, 419, 304, 4718, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 432, 10277, 13, 576, 6894, 1265, 387, 330, 8926, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 3263, 576, 7042, 1265, 387, 458, 7546, 2474, 432, 594, 264, 1760, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 432, 438, 314, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 21, 15, 15, 15, 15, 335, 311, 2506, 432, 4240, 323, 30339, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 11, 448, 6169, 17194, 323, 76602, 13, 7281, 11, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 4718, 11, 807, 2578, 387, 1667, 432, 369, 821, 8692, 476, 17590, 11, 773, 13403, 374, 1376, 13, 4710, 40, 1513, 944, 1744, 279, 1196, 6801, 5107, 1995, 11, 1101, 279, 13064, 304, 279, 5189, 3561, 13, 2379, 2578, 387, 13295, 419, 369, 264, 2390, 476, 1895, 11, 773, 8241, 23560, 323, 63594, 821, 374, 2989, 382, 14190, 11, 358, 1265, 7683, 279, 5535, 7042, 7071, 13, 4599, 311, 387, 2704, 11, 358, 3278, 6286, 429, 419, 374, 3118, 389, 17530, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 8788, 279, 1372, 374, 44868, 323, 2578, 387, 1483, 369, 5785, 9895, 382, 32313, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 9761, 4297, 279, 1196, 3880, 13, 4120, 311, 2182, 432, 678, 3786, 304, 279, 4718, 3561, 438, 11223, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 21, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'ce90907810b44ec2a390a84f89b4e34b', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 406, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.6008682250976562, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764037520.7170486}}</strong>"
