    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '3a9816b923d74613a5afe7fe3bd1e5ab', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.785076141357422, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766507376.965306}}</strong>"

First, I need to figure out who the user is and what they need this for. They could be a student working on a project, a researcher compiling data, or maybe someone creating a simple app that requires such information.\\n\\nSince they specified JSON, which is a data interchange format, they probably plan to use this data elsewhere, maybe integrating it into a website or another application. JSON is lightweight and good for that, so they must need structured data rather than raw text.\\n\\nI should focus on providing accurate and up-to-date information. I\\'ll need to confirm the current population as it can change from year to year. Also, the capital of France is definitely Paris, so that\\'s certain. I\\'ll look up the most recent population figure, which should be around 7.6 million.\\n\\nThe user didn\\'t specify if they need additional details, but since they mentioned information, I can include the country name and region too. Just to make the JSON clean and organized, I\\'ll structure it with keys like \"country,\" \"region,\" and \"population.\" I should also make sure the population number is presented clearly, either as an integer or a formatted string for easy readability.\\n\\nWait, should I consider the date of the population? The user didn\\'t specify, so I\\'ll just include the number and let them handle any further updates if needed. Maybe they\\'ll want to run the app periodically to fetch the latest stats.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should be straightforward and user-friendly. I\\'ll double-check the numbers to avoid any mistakes, as accuracy is crucial for data like this.\\n</think>\\n\\n Sure! Here\\'s the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"region\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 7605000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the following information:\\n- **country**: The country where Paris is the capital, which is France.\\n- **region**: The administrative region of Paris.\\n- **population**: The estimated population of Paris.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. Let me start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital city, but I'm not exactly sure about the population numbers. I remember hearing it's one of the largest cities in the world, but I don't know the exact figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've seen somewhere that Paris has over 3 million people. Maybe 3.5 million? But I'm not certain. I should check some sources to confirm. Let me see, the last time I checked, the population was around 3.5 to 3.6 million. But I'm not sure if that's the most recent data. Population numbers can change yearly due to births, deaths, and migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think in 2022, the population was reported as approximately 3.56 million. That seems to be the figure I've seen in recent articles. So, putting that together, I can say that the capital of France is Paris, and its population is about 3.56 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to present this information in JSON format. JSON is a data format that's easy to read and write, and it's commonly used for transmitting data in web applications. The structure usually involves key-value pairs. So, I'll create a JSON object with a key \"capital\" whose value is \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" whose value is the number I found.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the number is formatted correctly. Using a comma after 356 makes it 3.56 million, which is clearer. Also, it's good practice to use proper formatting, so I'll include spaces around the commas for readability.\n",
      "\n",
