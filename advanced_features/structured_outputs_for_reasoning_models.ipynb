    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. \\n\\nFirst, I should recall what the capital of France is. I know it\\'s Paris, so that\\'s the key piece of information. Next, the population. I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number, but I remember it\\'s a large city with over 30 million people. Maybe around 3.5 to 3.6 million? I should check to be accurate, but since I don\\'t have access to the internet, I\\'ll go with the common figure I\\'ve heard before.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object with the key-value pairs: \"country\" for the capital and \"population\" for the number. \\n\\nWait, actually, the capital is a city, and the country is France. But the user specifically asked for the capital\\'s information, so maybe they want both the country and the capital listed. I should structure it so that \"country\" is France and \"capital\" is Paris, along with the population of Paris.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have a key for each piece of information: country, capital, and population. I\\'ll assign the respective values. Let me make sure the population number is correctly formatted, probably as an integer. \\n\\nI should write the JSON properly, starting with curly braces, commas between key-value pairs, and ensure the syntax is correct to avoid errors.

      "I'll check the INSEE website to get the latest data. As of my last update in 2023, I believe the population was around 2,170,000. But I should verify this to make sure it's accurate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I just looked it up, and the population in 2021 was approximately 2,175,000. That's the most recent figure I can find. So I can use that number for the response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to format this information into a JSON structure. The user specifically asked for the capital's name, the country, and the population. So the JSON should have a \"capital\" key with \"Paris\", a \"country\" key with \"France\", and a \"population\" key with the number 2175000.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted, with commas in the right places and quotes around the strings. Also, I need to represent the population as an integer since it's a whole number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look like this:\n",

      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's all the user asked for. They didn't specify any additional details or formatting beyond JSON, so this should meet their requirements. I should double-check if there are any other required fields or if they want more context, but based on the query, this seems sufficient.\n",
