    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is in New York and they want the current date and time along with the weather. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned two functions: get_current_weather and get_current_date. <br><br>I should probably start by getting the current date and time because that's part of their request. The function get_current_date requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I'll use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. I'll structure the function call as <function=date>{{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}}</function>.<br><br>Next, I need the weather information. For that, I'll use get_current_weather. The parameters needed are city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and the unit should be Fahrenheit since the user didn't specify otherwise. So the function call will be <function=weather>{{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}}</function>.<br><br>Now, I should combine these two function calls. I'll list them one after the other since they're separate requests. I'll make sure each function call is properly formatted with the correct parameters. <br><br>I also need to remember to include the sources. For the date and time, using the function is a direct call, so the source is the function itself. For the weather, it's from get_current_weather, so that's the source as well.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll send the two function calls with their respective parameters and add the sources at the end. I should make sure the response is clear and each function is on its own line for readability.<br><br><br>content: <function:date>{{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{  <br>  \"city\": \"New York\",  <br>  \"state\": \"NY\",  <br>  \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"  <br>}</function>  <br>Sources: get_current_date and get_current_weather functions</strong>"

JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out where the capital of France is. I think it\\'s Paris, but I should double-check that. Yep, definitely Paris.\\n\\nNext, they want the population, but they mentioned \"population,\" which can be tricky. Sometimes people refer to the urban area, sometimes the entire metropolitan area. I should check the latest data. I recall that Paris has a metropolitan area population over 20 million, but the city proper is around 2.2 million. It\\'s good to include both just in case.\\n\\nNow, structuring this into JSON. I need to define an object with a \"capital\" key and another object inside it for details. The details should have \"name\" as Paris, \"city\" as the proper city, \"country\" as France, and \"population\" as both the city and metropolitan area numbers.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets. Let me lay it out: the main key is \"capital\" with the value as another object containing all the details.\\n\\nAlso, I need to present this neatly so it\\'s clear and easy to read. Maybe each property on a new line for better readability.\\n\\nWait, should I include any units for the population? Probably not necessary here since the user didn\\'t specify units in JSON. We can just include the numbers as they are.\\n\\nOk, putting it all together. I\\'ll structure it with proper syntax, ensuring commas are correctly placed, especially after the final field. That way, the JSON is valid and can be used without errors.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON and offer further help in case they need more data. That way, I cover any potential follow-up questions they might have later.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"city\": \"The proper city is Paris (2.2 million people)\",\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"population\": {\\n      \"city\": \"2 million\",\\n      \"metropolitan area\": \"21 million\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet me know if you need further details!', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1380, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 12095, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 84194, 11, 8491, 12095, 382, 5847, 11, 807, 1366, 279, 7042, 11, 714, 807, 9733, 330, 44441, 1335, 892, 646, 387, 33453, 13, 17688, 1251, 8300, 311, 279, 15662, 3082, 11, 7025, 279, 4453, 57406, 3082, 13, 358, 1265, 1779, 279, 5535, 821, 13, 358, 19091, 429, 12095, 702, 264, 57406, 3082, 7042, 916, 220, 17, 15, 3526, 11, 714, 279, 3283, 6169, 374, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 13, 1084, 594, 1661, 311, 2924, 2176, 1101, 304, 1142, 382, 7039, 11, 2036, 1677, 419, 1119, 4718, 13, 358, 1184, 311, 6979, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 65063, 1, 1376, 323, 2441, 1633, 4766, 432, 369, 3565, 13, 576, 3565, 1265, 614, 330, 606, 1, 438, 12095, 11, 330, 8926, 1, 438, 279, 6169, 3283, 11, 330, 11141, 1, 438, 9625, 11, 323, 330, 44441, 1, 438, 2176, 279, 3283, 323, 57406, 3082, 5109, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 374, 10277, 23126, 448, 76602, 323, 38929, 13, 6771, 752, 10962, 432, 700, 25, 279, 1887, 1376, 374, 330, 65063, 1, 448, 279, 897, 438, 2441, 1633, 8482, 678, 279, 3565, 382, 13394, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 62166, 773, 432, 594, 2797, 323, 4135, 311, 1349, 13, 10696, 1817, 3343, 389, 264, 501, 1555, 369, 2664, 91494, 382, 14190, 11, 1265, 358, 2924, 894, 8153, 369, 279, 7042, 30, 37154, 537, 5871, 1588, 2474, 279, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 8153, 304, 4718, 13, 1205, 646, 1101, 2924, 279, 5109, 438, 807, 525, 382, 11578, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 13, 358, 3278, 5944, 432, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 22573, 76602, 525, 12440, 9099, 11, 5310, 1283, 279, 1590, 2070, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 323, 646, 387, 1483, 2041, 5975, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 323, 3010, 4623, 1492, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 358, 3421, 894, 4650, 1795, 5239, 4755, 807, 2578, 614, 2937, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 785, 6169, 3283, 374, 12095, 320, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 1251, 15752, 262, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 341, 414, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 17, 3526, 756, 414, 330, 4059, 30511, 3082, 788, 330, 17, 16, 3526, 698, 262, 456, 220, 456, 532, 13874, 19324, 10061, 752, 1414, 421, 498, 1184, 4623, 3565, 0, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'dfa44228ad32413d9cc69ed6e78db1e4', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'queue_time': 0.0002099829725921154, 'prefill_delay': 0.0004993928596377373, 'prefill_latency': 0.010946789290755987, 'completion_tokens': 473, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.0896105766296387, 'request_received_ts': 1762615765.2258353, 'request_scheduled_ts': 1762615765.2262728, 'decode_finished_ts': 1762615768.315446, 'forward_time': 3.088369396980852, 'response_sent_ts': 1762615768.3154995}}</strong>"

      "First, I'll identify the capital of France, which is definitely Paris. Now, I need to check the current population. As of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.1 million people. I should note that this is an approximate figure since populations can change yearly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I'll structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires keys and values, so I'll create an object with keys like \"capital\" and \"population\". Under \"capital\", I'll include both the city name and its nickname. For \"population\", I'll mention the approximate number and include a note about the estimate and growth rate.\n",

      "I should also keep the language simple and clear since the user didn't specify any particular complexity or technical jargon. Maybe they just want a straightforward response. I'll avoid any unnecessary details and stick to the essentials: the capital's name, nickname, and population stats.\n",
