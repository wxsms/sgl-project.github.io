    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '4f02aa955be348bbbcf9d7f469c11078', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.664841890335083, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766235821.3963192}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user asked me for the capital of France along with its population in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I should identify the key pieces of information needed. The capital city is obvious—Paris. Now, for the population, I know it\\'s a large city with a lot of residents, but I need to provide an accurate figure.\\n\\nI recall that Paris\\'s population is around 20-something million. But to be precise, I should look up the latest data. Let me think, as of the most recent estimates, the population has been growing each year. I believe in recent years, it\\'s over 21 million. Maybe around 21,624,000?\\n\\nNow, the user specifically asked for this information in JSON format. JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format that\\'s easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I\\'ll structure it with a key for the capital and another for the population.\\n\\nI should make sure the syntax is correct. Using double quotes for strings and appropriate commas. The keys should be user-friendly, like \"capital_name\" and \"population\". Putting it all together, the JSON object should have the capital as \"Paris\" and the population as 21624000.\\n\\nI need to check if there are any updates on the population count since the last data release.

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user just asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to figure out what exactly they're asking for. The capital of France is definitely Paris, so that's straightforward. They want the population, so I should look that up. I remember that the population numbers can change every year, especially since estimates can vary. The latest data I have is from 2021, where Paris had around 2,182,308 residents. But I should note that this is an estimate because the exact number can be tricky to pin down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"capital\" for the city, \"country\" for France, and \"population\" for the number. I'll include the population number as both the estimated figure and the approximate exact figure since I don't have the precise count.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also add a description to give some context about the population figure. It's important to mention that it's an estimate to set the right expectations. Maybe I'll phrase it as a note within the JSON for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking about the user's intent, they might be using this data for a project, a report, or perhaps just general knowledge. They could be a student, a researcher, or someone planning an event in Paris. Providing the information in a clear and concise JSON format should make it easy for them to integrate into their work or use directly in applications that consume JSON data.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct to avoid any parsing issues. Using double quotes for keys and ensuring that the commas are in the right places is crucial. Also, the population numbers should be in a numeric format, not a string, so that any applications using this data can process it correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I'll double-check the population number to ensure accuracy. If the user needs the most recent data, I might consider suggesting sources where they can get the exact figure, but since they just asked for the information, providing the commonly accepted estimate should suffice unless they ask for more details later.\n",
