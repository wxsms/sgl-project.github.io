    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '146c7fc1c93d479a96c2ff1ccca7e3c3', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 3.3189001083374023, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766039449.154229}}\n"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

They mentioned France before, so I need to figure out which capital that is. They might not know it\\'s Paris, so I\\'ll mention that clearly.\\n\\nFirst, I should confirm the basics. Paris is the capital, right? That\\'s a fact. Then, the population numbers. I think the 2021 figure was around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe it\\'s slightly different, so better to have the range or exact number.\\n\\nNext, the region or department it\\'s in. Paris is in the Île-de-France region, specifically department 75, which is the 25th department. I\\'ll include that so they know the exact location in France.\\n\\nI should also think about why the user is asking this. They might be doing a project, writing something, or maybe just curious. Since they asked for JSON, they probably want a structured data format for easy access. So, organizing the information neatly into key-value pairs will be helpful.\\n\\nMaybe they also want some additional info, like the area or government type, but since they only asked for population, I\\'ll stick to essentials to keep it concise. Ensuring the JSON is properly formatted without any syntax errors is crucial to avoid issues when they use it.\\n\\nLastly, I should make sure my response is clear and informative, providing all necessary details so they get exactly what they\\'re looking for.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the structured information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"region\": \"Île-de-France\",\\n    \"department\": 75,\\n    \"population\": 2175000\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON includes the name of the capital (Paris), the region it is located in (Île-de-France), the department number (75), and the approximate population as of the latest data.', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 1101, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 2379, 9733, 9625, 1573, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 892, 6722, 429, 374, 13, 2379, 2578, 537, 1414, 432, 594, 12095, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 6286, 429, 9355, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1265, 7683, 279, 31774, 13, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 1290, 30, 2938, 594, 264, 2097, 13, 5005, 11, 279, 7042, 5109, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 7071, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 10696, 432, 594, 10078, 2155, 11, 773, 2664, 311, 614, 279, 2088, 476, 4734, 1372, 382, 5847, 11, 279, 5537, 476, 9292, 432, 594, 304, 13, 12095, 374, 304, 279, 59108, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 5537, 11, 11689, 9292, 220, 22, 20, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 20, 339, 9292, 13, 358, 3278, 2924, 429, 773, 807, 1414, 279, 4734, 3728, 304, 9625, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 1744, 911, 3170, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 419, 13, 2379, 2578, 387, 3730, 264, 2390, 11, 4378, 2494, 11, 476, 7196, 1101, 22208, 13, 8704, 807, 4588, 369, 4718, 11, 807, 4658, 1366, 264, 32930, 821, 3561, 369, 4135, 2615, 13, 2055, 11, 34721, 279, 1995, 62166, 1119, 1376, 19083, 13530, 686, 387, 10950, 382, 21390, 807, 1083, 1366, 1045, 5107, 3546, 11, 1075, 279, 3082, 476, 3033, 943, 11, 714, 2474, 807, 1172, 4588, 369, 7042, 11, 358, 3278, 9214, 311, 58786, 311, 2506, 432, 63594, 13, 57868, 1677, 279, 4718, 374, 10277, 23126, 2041, 894, 19482, 5975, 374, 16587, 311, 5648, 4714, 979, 807, 990, 432, 382, 80486, 11, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 847, 2033, 374, 2797, 323, 38219, 11, 8241, 678, 5871, 3565, 773, 807, 633, 6896, 1128, 807, 2299, 3330, 369, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 32930, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 3943, 788, 330, 71807, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 756, 262, 330, 27314, 788, 220, 22, 20, 345, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 20, 15, 15, 15, 198, 220, 456, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 5646, 279, 829, 315, 279, 6722, 320, 59604, 701, 279, 5537, 432, 374, 7407, 304, 320, 71807, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 701, 279, 9292, 1372, 320, 22, 20, 701, 323, 279, 44868, 7042, 438, 315, 279, 5535, 821, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'bdea7dd71a184285a8b20750488df7b8', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 415, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.660947799682617, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766039467.6545396}}</strong>"
