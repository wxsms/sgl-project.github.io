    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '15858cd1540f48d5ad103ebe664d4ef7', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3399600982666016, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1767110447.3112972}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to get the information and population of the capital city of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the capital of France is. I remember it\\'s Paris, right? So the main capital is Paris, and the Macron cdrom is a backup if that fails, just in case.\\n\\nNow, I need to find out the population of Paris, specifically the capital, not the whole country. I\\'m not exactly sure about the exact number, but I think it\\'s around 2 million people. But I should double-check that. Maybe I can look up recent data, but since I don\\'t have access right now, I\\'ll go with a commonly cited figure.\\n\\nWait, sometimes cities have population estimates that change every few years. So perhaps the population is a little over 2 million or maybe 2 and a half million. I think in recent years, it\\'s been steadily increasing, so maybe around 2.2 to 2.3 million. \\n\\nAlright, putting this together, I need to create a JSON structure. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll have a main key, something like \"capital_info\", which contains both the capital city and its population. \\n\\nSo maybe like this:\\n{\\n  \"capital_info\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": \"2,223,745\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nI should also include a fallback, just in case the primary source is unavailable. So I\\'ll add \"macron_c住宅用 Listen, perhaps a backup city name, but I\\'m not sure what would be appropriate. Maybe another major city like Lyon or� (typo there) but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, sticking with a fallback just in case the main data fails to load.\\n\\nWait, the initial assistant response just gave me a JSON object with \"capital\" name and \"population\". Should I include any additional fields like region or area? Probably not necessary unless specifically asked for. So I\\'ll stick with the given structure but make sure it accurately reflects the population.\\n\\nAlso, I should format the numbers correctly. Using commas for thousands can make it more readable, so 2,223,745 is better than 2223745. That\\'s more standard, especially in official documents or programming.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is the currency symbol for the population, but population is just a number, so that\\'s not needed.\\n\\nOkay, I think that\\'s about it.

      "Generated text: Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query about the capital of France. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for. They want information and the population of Paris, which is the capital, in JSON format. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should confirm that Paris is indeed the capital of France. I know it's correct, but better to be sure. From what I remember, Paris has been the capital for a long time, but I should double-check that. Looking it up, yes, Paris is the current capital since the early 19th century, so that's settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find the population of Paris. I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I think it's around 2 million. Wait, is that accurate? I recall that major cities in France, like Paris, are among the most populous in Europe, so a population in the 2 million range makes sense. Maybe it's exactly 2,100,000? That sounds familiar. I'll go with that for now, but I should note that the figure might change over time due to births, deaths, and migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON is a data format that's easy to read and write, and it's often used in web applications. So I'll structure it with a key \"capital\" and its value as \"Paris\", another key \"population\" with the number 2100000, and a third key \"country\" as \"France\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2100000,\n",
      "  \"country\": \"France\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if the user might need the population as a string or integer. In JSON, numbers don't need quotes, but strings do. So since 2100000 is a number, it should be without quotes. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the user is using this data for a project or presentation. Maybe they need it programmatically, so accuracy is key. I should mention that the population figure is approximate and might change. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted so it doesn't break when they use it. Indentation isn't necessary, but it's easier to read with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's all. I'll present the information clearly and concisely in the JSON format as requested.\n",
