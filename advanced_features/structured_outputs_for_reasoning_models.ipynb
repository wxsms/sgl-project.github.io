    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I responded with Paris, its population of around 2.1 million, and included some key facts. Now, the user is following up with a new query about the capitals of other countries. They provided a list of countries and want the same JSON structure for each.<br><br>First, I need to figure out what the user is really looking for. They might be creating a dataset or a project that requires the capitals of various nations. Maybe they're a student working on a geography assignment or a developer building a mapping application. Either way, they need accurate and reliable data.<br><br>Looking at the list they provided: Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA. That's quite a comprehensive list, covering multiple continents.<br><br>I should make sure each country's capital is correct. I know some capitals off the top of my head, like Albania's Tirana, Algeria's Algiers, Australia's Canberra. But I should double-check the rest to avoid mistakes. For example, I'm pretty sure Germany's capital is Berlin, but I should confirm that. Same with countries like Mexico and Spain, where the capital is in a different state.<br><br>The user wants the information in JSON format, so each country will have a key with its name and capital, along with the population. I'll need to look up the most recent population estimates for each. Population numbers can change, so it's important to use the latest data. For example, Germany's population is around 83 million, while the UK's is about 67 million.<br><br>I should structure the JSON array correctly, ensuring each object has the same keys. Also, I'll need to format the numbers properly, using commas for readability. For instance, 2.1 million should be written as 2.1 million, not 2100000.<br><br>I wonder if the user needs the population data to be dynamic or if they prefer static numbers. Since they didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent estimates available. Also, I should present the data clearly, maybe adding comments or organizing it in a way that's easy to read, even though it's just a list.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the possibility of the user needing this data for a presentation or a report. If that's the case, accuracy is crucial. I should verify each piece of information to ensure reliability. For example, confirming that Japan's capital is Tokyo and not another city.<br><br>I should also think about the user's deeper needs. They might be building a quiz app where users can test their knowledge of country capitals, or perhaps they're creating a mapping tool that requires capital locations. Either way, providing accurate and up-to-date information is key.<br><br>I'll start by listing each country with its capital and population, making sure each entry is a separate object in the JSON array.

First, I need to figure out how to get the current date and time. Looking at the available functions, there's 'get_current_date' which requires a timezone parameter. New York is in the Eastern Time Zone, so the timezone parameter should be 'America/New_York'.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the user specified New York. So I'll use 'get_current_weather' with the city as 'New York' and state as 'NY' since that's the two-letter abbreviation. The unit isn't specified, so I'll default to Celsius, but I should mention that in the response just in case the user prefers Fahrenheit.<br><br>Now, I need to structure the message properly. I'll start by informing the user they're in New York, then list the date and time using the function call. After that, I'll mention the weather details, including temperature and condition, and specify the unit used. I'll also add a friendly note asking if they need more information or the exact temperature in Fahrenheit.<br><br>I should make sure the functions are called correctly with the right parameters in JSON format. Each function call should be on its own line, following the specified structure. Also, I need to include the source links for both functions to provide credibility to the information.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll first state the location, then each function call with the parameters, followed by the weather details and a friendly closing. This should cover everything the user asked for and provide a clear, helpful response.<br><br><br>content: You are in New York. Here's the current information:<br><br><function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function><br><br>The current weather in New York is [temperature]°C, [weather condition]. <br><br>Let me know if you'd like the temperature in Fahrenheit or any other details! 😊<br>[Source](https://docs.example.com/get_current_date) [Source](https://docs.example.com/get_current_weather)</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to respond to this query where the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, okay, let\\'s break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall where the capital of France is. I think Paris is the capital, right? Wait, I should double-check that in my memory. Yeah, Paris is definitely France\\'s capital city. Okay, so that\\'s the first piece of information.\\n\\nNext, population. Population numbers can change over time, so I need to make sure I have the most recent estimate. I remember that major cities in Europe have been going through population growth or decline depending on factors like migration, birth rates, and so on. I think Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not exactly sure about the exact number. Let me see... I believe it\\'s around 3.5 million people. That seems familiar, but is that accurate? I should verify that in my knowledge.\\n\\nAdditionally, the user is asking for \"information.\" So I should include other relevant data about the capital. Maybe the administrative region, like the department or something like that. Paris is in the Default department, also known as le ISSN, which is 92. That\\'s a code I use to remember it. The department also has anuts, which are cooperations in services for unity and social networks. Wait, I think that\\'s correct; Paris Est, Paris Nord, etc., are different arrondissements that are part of the default department. So I should mention that there are 25 arrondissements in department 92.\\n\\nThen, there\\'s Paris Qi, which is a sub-department. I believe that\\'s in the Marais district, also known as the arrondissement 13. Yes, that\\'s right. So, Paris Qi is located there.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure should have a \"capital\" key with the necessary information. Under \"capital,\" we\\'ll include \"name,\" \"department,\" \"nuts,\" and \"PARIS Qi\" as subkeys. Then, an \"population\" key with the current approximate number, probably around 3.5 million since that\\'s what I remember.\\n\\nBut wait, I should also think about whether to mention increases or decreases in population. Did Paris\\'s population increase or decrease? I think it\\'s increasing, but again, I\\'m not entirely sure of the exact statistic. Maybe I should stick to the approximate population without specific growth rates to keep it simple.\\n\\nAlso, is this information up to date? Population figures can change every year, so maybe I should mention that the figure is approximate and based on recent data. That way, the user knows it\\'s a general estimate.\\n\\nOh, and what about the languages spoken there? Paris is a multicultural city with French being the main language, but other languages like English, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, German, and Arabic are also spoken. Including that could add more depth to the information provided.\\n\\nWait, does the user want the JSON to include all these details? They asked for \"information and population,\" so I think including both the detailed capital info and the population figure is appropriate. So, the JSON structure I outlined earlier should cover that.\\n\\nLet me consider any potential issues or mistakes. I don\\'t think \"Administrative Nuts\" is a commonly used term, but I believe it\\'s a correct term for the area subdivisions in France. Maybe I should check the exact spelling to be sure. Paris has the default department as 92, which is correct.\\n\\nAlso, the Paris Qi under Paris 13 seems accurate. Marais is known as a historic and vibrant area with lots of businesses and tourist attractions, so that\\'s a good addition.\\n\\nOverall, the key points are the name, department,nuts, Paris Qi, and population. I think I\\'ve covered all the necessary information. I should structure this into JSON without any errors and ensure that the data is accurate, as that\\'s essential for the user\\'s information needs.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"department\": \"92\",\\n    \"nuts\": \"92SFM\",\\n    \"parisQi\": {\\n
