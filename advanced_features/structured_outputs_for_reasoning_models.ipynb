    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to find out the population of the capital of France and present it in JSON format. Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. Okay, so I need to figure out the current population of Paris. I remember that cities can have varying population numbers, and it changes over time due to births, deaths, and migration. I don\\'t know the exact number, but I have a vague idea that Paris is a large city with a significant population.\\n\\nI think about the recent years, maybe around 2020 or 2021. I recall reading somewhere that Paris has over 3 million residents. But I\\'m not entirely sure if it\\'s exactly 3.5 million, as I seem to remember a specific figure. Maybe 3.5 million is the updated number from recent censuses?\\n\\nI should also consider how population figures are reported. Often, official sources like the National Institute of Statistics and Registration (INSEE) or the French National Institute of Demographic Studies (Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Démographiques INSAD) would have the most accurate data. Perhaps they\\'ve updated the population since the last official count, which was a few years back.\\n\\nWait, I think there was a census in 2020. If the last official population figure was from that, it might still be accurate unless there have been significant events causing the population to change in the intervening years. But since I don\\'t have exact information about events between 2020 and now, I\\'ll go with the figure I remember.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON structure should have a key for the population. I\\'ll name it something descriptive, like \"population\". The value will be the number, which I believe is 3,525,000. To present this neatly, I\\'ll format it using a JSON structure with parentheses for readability.\\n\\nI should double-check if 3.5 million is correct. Maybe I can think of other references. I know that major cities in France, like Lyon or Olivier, have populations around a million, but Paris is much bigger. I think places like Lyon have around 1.1 million, so Paris being 3.5 million makes sense as a capital.\\n\\nAnother thought: sometimes population figures are approximate or given in a range. But since I\\'m pretty confident it\\'s around 3.5 million, I can be precise. Also, population figures can vary by source, but for the purpose of this question, providing 3.5 million should be acceptable.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ll structure the JSON as follows: a key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and a key \"population\" with the value 3525000. That should fulfill the requirement neatly.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3525000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 700, 279, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 323, 3042, 432, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 3019, 553, 3019, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 35439, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 9720, 646, 614, 28765, 7042, 5109, 11, 323, 432, 4344, 916, 882, 4152, 311, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 11906, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1414, 279, 4734, 1372, 11, 714, 358, 614, 264, 39046, 4522, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3460, 3283, 448, 264, 5089, 7042, 382, 40, 1744, 911, 279, 3213, 1635, 11, 7196, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 476, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 13, 358, 19091, 5290, 14696, 429, 12095, 702, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 10826, 13, 1988, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 2704, 421, 432, 594, 6896, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 11, 438, 358, 2803, 311, 6099, 264, 3151, 7071, 13, 10696, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 374, 279, 6049, 1372, 504, 3213, 272, 724, 4776, 1939, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 1246, 7042, 12396, 525, 4961, 13, 34916, 11, 3946, 8173, 1075, 279, 5055, 9976, 315, 24624, 323, 24516, 320, 687, 48740, 8, 476, 279, 8585, 5055, 9976, 315, 4724, 12679, 18720, 320, 641, 3696, 332, 5055, 409, 1187, 12166, 96396, 1842, 939, 28024, 83, 28146, 422, 16647, 3178, 8303, 25692, 1808, 8, 1035, 614, 279, 1429, 13382, 821, 13, 18765, 807, 3003, 6049, 279, 7042, 2474, 279, 1537, 3946, 1760, 11, 892, 572, 264, 2421, 1635, 1182, 382, 14190, 11, 358, 1744, 1052, 572, 264, 43602, 304, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 13, 1416, 279, 1537, 3946, 7042, 7071, 572, 504, 429, 11, 432, 2578, 2058, 387, 13382, 7241, 1052, 614, 1012, 5089, 4357, 14381, 279, 7042, 311, 2297, 304, 279, 88401, 1635, 13, 1988, 2474, 358, 1513, 944, 614, 4734, 1995, 911, 4357, 1948, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 323, 1431, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 279, 7071, 358, 6099, 382, 4416, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1265, 614, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 3278, 829, 432, 2494, 52844, 11, 1075, 330, 44441, 3263, 576, 897, 686, 387, 279, 1372, 11, 892, 358, 4411, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 17, 20, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 2014, 3042, 419, 62166, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 432, 1667, 264, 4718, 5944, 448, 73975, 369, 91494, 382, 40, 1265, 1990, 15934, 421, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 374, 4396, 13, 10696, 358, 646, 1744, 315, 1008, 15057, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 3598, 9720, 304, 9625, 11, 1075, 55201, 476, 77018, 11, 614, 21910, 2163, 264, 3526, 11, 714, 12095, 374, 1753, 11243, 13, 358, 1744, 7482, 1075, 55201, 614, 2163, 220, 16, 13, 16, 3526, 11, 773, 12095, 1660, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 3643, 5530, 438, 264, 6722, 382, 14037, 3381, 25, 7025, 7042, 12396, 525, 44868, 476, 2661, 304, 264, 2088, 13, 1988, 2474, 358, 2776, 5020, 16506, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 11, 358, 646, 387, 23560, 13, 7281, 11, 7042, 12396, 646, 13289, 553, 2530, 11, 714, 369, 279, 7428, 315, 419, 3405, 11, 8241, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 1265, 387, 21555, 382, 4416, 11, 358, 3278, 5944, 279, 4718, 438, 11017, 25, 264, 1376, 330, 65063, 1, 448, 279, 897, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 264, 1376, 330, 44441, 1, 448, 279, 897, 220, 18, 20, 17, 20, 15, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 1265, 20423, 279, 16287, 62166, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 17, 20, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '6e3a067770954edfb9fb98b152645e00', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'queue_time': 0.00018809200264513493, 'prefill_delay': 0.0005081610288470984, 'prefill_latency': 0.010934656951576471, 'completion_tokens': 615, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.8453450202941895, 'request_received_ts': 1762589822.3753448, 'request_scheduled_ts': 1762589822.3758197, 'decode_finished_ts': 1762589826.2206898, 'forward_time': 3.8440591460093856, 'response_sent_ts': 1762589826.2207353}}</strong>"
