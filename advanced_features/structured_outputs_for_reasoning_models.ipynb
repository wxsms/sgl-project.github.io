    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '4ef5bbbe78714443bfbaef826bc63af4', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.332168340682983, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764536040.473525}}</strong>"

Let me start by recalling that the capital of France is Paris. Good, that\\'s straightforward.\\n\\nNow, I need to find the most recent population data. I remember that population figures can change year by year, so I should check the latest available statistics. According to the 2020 census, the population was around 21 million. That seems pretty accurate, but I should make sure it\\'s up-to-date. I believe the European Union often uses the 2020 data for such figures in their reports and databases.\\n\\nThe user also wants this information in JSON format. So, I should structure it with a \"capital\" key pointing to \"Paris\" and a \"population\" key pointing to the number, 21000000. Maybe present it like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 21000000}.\\n\\nI should consider if there\\'s any additional information the user might find useful but hasn\\'t asked for. They might be interested in knowing that Paris is not only the capital but the largest city in France. Including that could add value without making the response too lengthy.\\n\\nI wonder if the user is working on a project, maybe a school assignment or a presentation. Providing accurate and concise data is crucial for their work. Ensuring the JSON is valid is important because it\\'s a structured format, often used in programming or data analysis.\\n\\nWait, should I include the units for the population? The user simply asked for the population number, so I don\\'t need to specify \\'inhabitants\\' unless they request it. Keeping it straightforward is probably better here.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the JSON format is correctly formatted with proper commas and braces. Any syntax errors could prevent the user from using the data effectively.\\n\\nThinking about the user\\'s deeper needs, they might be looking for a quick, reliable data point without having to research themselves. By providing the information succinctly in JSON, I can save them time and ensure accuracy.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together, I\\'ll respond with the JSON containing the capital and population, structure it clearly, and that\\'s it. It should meet the user\\'s request comprehensively without unnecessary details.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 21000000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 6771, 752, 1191, 553, 88646, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 7684, 11, 429, 594, 30339, 382, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 7042, 12396, 646, 2297, 1042, 553, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1779, 279, 5535, 2500, 13142, 13, 10548, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 279, 7042, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 16, 3526, 13, 2938, 4977, 5020, 13382, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 432, 594, 705, 4686, 18413, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7513, 9145, 3545, 5711, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 821, 369, 1741, 12396, 304, 862, 6682, 323, 31806, 382, 785, 1196, 1083, 6801, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 1265, 5944, 432, 448, 264, 330, 65063, 1, 1376, 21633, 311, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 1376, 21633, 311, 279, 1372, 11, 220, 17, 16, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 13, 10696, 3042, 432, 1075, 419, 25, 5212, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 382, 40, 1265, 2908, 421, 1052, 594, 894, 5107, 1995, 279, 1196, 2578, 1477, 5390, 714, 12492, 944, 4588, 369, 13, 2379, 2578, 387, 8014, 304, 14063, 429, 12095, 374, 537, 1172, 279, 6722, 714, 279, 7772, 3283, 304, 9625, 13, 55121, 429, 1410, 912, 897, 2041, 3259, 279, 2033, 2238, 34206, 382, 40, 5775, 421, 279, 1196, 374, 3238, 389, 264, 2390, 11, 7196, 264, 2906, 16319, 476, 264, 15496, 13, 80100, 13382, 323, 63594, 821, 374, 16587, 369, 862, 975, 13, 57868, 1677, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 374, 2989, 1576, 432, 594, 264, 32930, 3561, 11, 3545, 1483, 304, 15473, 476, 821, 6358, 382, 14190, 11, 1265, 358, 2924, 279, 8153, 369, 279, 7042, 30, 576, 1196, 4936, 4588, 369, 279, 7042, 1372, 11, 773, 358, 1513, 944, 1184, 311, 13837, 364, 258, 96702, 1783, 6, 7241, 807, 1681, 432, 13, 55378, 432, 30339, 374, 4658, 2664, 1588, 382, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 429, 279, 4718, 3561, 374, 12440, 23126, 448, 6169, 76602, 323, 59191, 13, 5765, 19482, 5975, 1410, 5358, 279, 1196, 504, 1667, 279, 821, 13444, 382, 93945, 911, 279, 1196, 594, 19117, 3880, 11, 807, 2578, 387, 3330, 369, 264, 3974, 11, 14720, 821, 1459, 2041, 3432, 311, 3412, 5577, 13, 3216, 8241, 279, 1995, 98632, 398, 304, 4718, 11, 358, 646, 3581, 1105, 882, 323, 5978, 13403, 382, 71486, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 5889, 448, 279, 4718, 8482, 279, 6722, 323, 7042, 11, 5944, 432, 9355, 11, 323, 429, 594, 432, 13, 1084, 1265, 3367, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 12674, 26916, 2041, 25165, 3565, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'bad0fb5f1b374cf08f15d9e1507d3fb5', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 512, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.2917869091033936, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764536058.8024645}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. Let me start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital, that's for sure. But I'm not exactly sure about the population number. I think it's in the hundreds of millions, but I don't remember the exact figure. Maybe around 200 million? I've heard that Paris is a big city, but the country's population is much larger. \n",

So if the country is about 67 million people, then Paris, being the capital, must have a significant portion of that, but not the majority. \n",

      "I'm not exactly sure about the latest population numbers, so I should check if there's a more recent figure. I think in the early 2000s, Paris was around 12.5 million. But I'm not certain if that's up to date. Maybe the population has grown a bit since then. \n",
      "\n",
