    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'ead3caa73a244ee29a6789c21d3855e4', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3609561920166016, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764253248.6471891}}</strong>"

First, I need to understand exactly what they\\'re asking for. The capital of France is巴黎, so the main focus is on gathering accurate data about this city.\\n\\nI should think about what specific details they might need. Population is given, but they might also want to include other attributes like area, maybe the administrative region, and perhaps some notable landmarks or climate data to add more information and context. I\\'ll need to provide these details in a structured JSON format, which is useful for data interchange.\\n\\nI remember that the current population of Paris is around 2.2 million, but I should verify that to ensure accuracy. Also, knowing the exact administrative division (Arrondissement) where Paris is located helps in completing the information. Including administrative area can be helpful for readers who want more details about the city\\'s geography.\\n\\nI should consider if they want the population figures to be dynamic, perhaps tied to an API, but since they didn\\'t specify, I\\'ll just provide the current estimates. Adding events or cultural highlights could add more depth, making the JSON info more comprehensive and useful for the user.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll structure the JSON, making sure each field is clearly labeled and all necessary data is included. Keeping it simple and well-organized will ensure the user finds it easy to use and understand. I should also mention that the data is approximate or can be obtained via an API if they need more dynamic or detailed information later on.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"current_population\": 2200000,\\n    \"estimated_population\": {\\n      \"as_of\": \"2023\",\\n      \"value\": 2235000\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"area\": {\\n    \"total_area\": 105.58,\\n    \"administrative_area\": 20.36\\n  },\\n  \"admin_division\": \"The administrative division is Paris, which is part of the Île-de-France Paris Research and Innovation Quarter.\",\\n  \" notable_landmarks\": {\\n    \"the_paris_operating實 flowers marked after\",\"the lipstick mark\",\\n    \"the Mona Lisa\",\\n    \"the Eiffel Tower\",\\n    \"the Louvre Museum\"\\n  },\\n  \"climate\": {\\n    \"average_annual TEMPERATURE\": \"12°C\",\\n    \"average_annual RAINFALL\": \"611 mm\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON provides a comprehensive overview of Paris, including its population, area, notable landmarks, and climate.

Oh yeah, I think the population is approximately 2.2 million. That seems a bit low, but maybe that includes other cities or provinces in France? No, wait, the question is about the population of the capital, so it's just Paris, not the whole country.\n",
