    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",

    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand exactly what they\\'re looking for. They want a JSON response, which is an object in JavaScript. So I\\'ll need a key for the information and another for the population.\\n\\nI know that The capital city of France is Paris. That\\'s a given, so I\\'ll start with that. Then, I need to provide some key pieces of information. Paris is a major city, so I should mention that it\\'s the capital, the Paris metropolitan area has a lot of residents, it\\'s the most populated city in France, and where the Eiffel Tower is located. Also, it\\'s a cultural hub with landmarks like the Louvre and the Teddy Bear museum, popular with tourists.\\n\\nNow, for the population. I remember that Paris has a very large metropolitan area. As of the latest estimates, it\\'s around 21 million people. The urban area is about 27 million. I should also note that this can change over time due to factors like migration and changes in recording thresholds for statistics.\\n\\nI should structure this information in a JSON format, so each point is a key-value pair. I\\'ll have \"capital_information\" as an object containing the sub-information points and \"population\" as another object with sub-parts like urban area, metropolitan area, and landmarks.\\n\\nI need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas in the right places and the keys are in quotes. Also, I should avoid any markdown formatting as per the instructions.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll draft the JSON, including each piece of information and population data.
