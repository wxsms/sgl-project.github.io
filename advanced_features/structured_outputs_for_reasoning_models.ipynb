    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '425a56091a63446d94c32bd2eaff2d25', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.4320170879364014, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1767412674.0283048}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France. Let me try to break this down. First, I need to recall which city is the capital of France. Well, Paris is the capital, right? I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s correct. \\n\\nNext, the user wants the population. I remember that Paris is one of the largest cities in the world, but I\\'m not exactly sure about the current population. I think it\\'s around 2 million. But wait, I should verify if that number is accurate as of the latest update, maybe recent data from 2023 or something. It could have changed a bit over the years.\\n\\nAlso, the user mentioned including information. So, maybe I should provide a general fact about Paris besides just the population. I know Paris is known for its rich history, cultural landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, the Arc de Triomphe, and its significant role in art and literature. Maybe adding a bit more about its significance as the cultural and economic center would be good.\\n\\nI should present all of this in a JSON format as the user requested. JSON format organizes data into key-value pairs, so I\\'ll structure it with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and \" facts\". I\\'ll keep the population as approximately 2 million and the facts as a list of the historical and cultural aspects I mentioned. I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct to avoid any errors.\\n\\nDo I need to include the unit for the population?

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user just asked me to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me think about this. The capital of France is definitely Paris. I'm pretty sure that's correct, but maybe I should double-check to make sure I'm not mixing it up with another country's capital. Paris is the largest city in France and has been the capital for a long time, so that's right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to represent data structures in a readable format. It's commonly used for transmitting data in web applications. So, I need to structure this data as a JSON object. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I should identify the key(s) and the corresponding values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main pieces of information the user is asking for are the name of the capital and its population. The name is straightforward: Paris. The population is a bit trickier because it can change over time. I should look up the most recent population estimate. Let me recall or look up the current population of Paris. As of the latest data I have, the population is around 2,165,000. I think that's an approximate figure, so I should note that it's an estimate and perhaps mention that it can vary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include any additional information? The user just asked for the name and population, so maybe that's all. But it's good practice to make the JSON as informative as possible. Maybe I can add some related facts, like the administrative region, area, or landmarks. That way, it's more comprehensive. Paris is a major city in Île-de-France, which is one of the threeGreater Paris metro areas. The metropolitan area of Paris has a larger population, but the city proper might be around 2 million. Including that could be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the date when this data was current. Maybe I can add that as a key, like \"date,\" and set it to something like \"2023-10-10,\" just as an example. That makes the JSON more accurate and useful for anyone accessing it programmatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, structuring the JSON object. I'll start with \"name\" and \"population\" as the main keys. Then, I can add \"related_facts\" as an array containing other information. Each item in that array can be a key-value pair as well. Let me make sure the syntax is correct: all keys and string values are in quotes, numbers are without quotes, and everything is properly indented for readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"name\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2165000,\n",
      "  \"related_facts\": [\n",
      "    {\n",
      "      \"key\": \"administrative_region\",\n",
      "      \"value\": \"Île-de-France\"\n",
      "    },\n",
      "    {\n",
      "      \"key\": \"metropolitan_area\",\n",
      "      \"value\": \"2,500,000 people (approx.)\"\n",
      "    },\n",
      "    {\n",
      "      \"key\": \"area\",\n",
      "      \"value\": \"12.5 square kilometers\"\n",
      "    }\n",
      "  ],\n",
      "  \"date\": \"2023-10-10\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers the necessary details. I should make sure the population figure is accurate and clearly stated. Also, using the approximate symbol where the population might change ensures it's clear it's an estimate. This structure should be easy for the user to parse and use as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the user is a developer or just someone looking for data. If they're a developer, providing the JSON with a date key might be useful for tracking updates. If they're just using it for information, the related facts add extra value. Either way, this should meet their needs. I should also consider if there's any more data they might find useful, but given the request, sticking to the main points is best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I should make sure there are no typos in the JSON. It's easy to miss a quote or comma, which could break the entire structure. Double-checking is always a good idea, especially if this JSON will be used in a program or another application. Alright, I think I've covered all the bases here. Time to put it all together in the correct JSON format.\n",
