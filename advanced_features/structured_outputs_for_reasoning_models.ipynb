    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user just asked for the information and population of France\\'s capital in JSON format. Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward, but I should double-check that to make sure. Yeah, Paris has been the capital since the十六世纪, so that\\'s confirmed.\\n\\nNext, the user wants the population. I need an accurate figure here. From what I remember, the population of Paris is around five million. But wait, that might be an old number. I should look up the latest data. According to recent estimates, the population is approximately 2,147,000 as of 2023.\\n\\nNow, how detailed do they want it? They asked for information, so I should include some key facts about Paris. Let\\'s see, Paris is known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. It\\'s a cultural, economic, and political center. Maybe also mention it\\'s the second-largest city in France and located in the Île-de-France region.\\n\\nOrganizations based in Paris are important too. There\\'s the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre,口服 chase ,bounded by the Seine River, and it\\'s home to the Sorbonne University. Including these details will give a comprehensive view.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I should structure this in JSON. Keys like \"city_name\", \"population\", \"key_facts\", and \"landmarks\" would work well. I\\'ll make sure the JSON is properly formatted without any syntax errors.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user might be looking for more detailed stats, like area or density. They didn\\'t specify, so I\\'ll stick to what they asked for. Also, considering the population can vary based on sources and time, using the most recent and reliable figure is crucial.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present it neatly, ensuring that the JSON is valid and easy to read.

They might not have much experience with JSON, so providing a clear example is important.\n",

I recall that as of the last census in 2020, Paris had a population of around 2,178,357. But I should double-check that to make sure. Maybe look up the latest data from a reliable source like the INSEE website or the official government stats.\n",

      "Next, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format, so it should have a key-value structure. I'll create an object with \"capital\" and \"population\" as keys. Under \"capital,\" I'll include details like the city's name, nickname, and whether it's the capital. Under \"population,\" I'll add the current population, year of the data, and any notes about the source or estimation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include all that in one JSON or break it down? Probably better to keep it concise but informative. So, in the JSON, under \"capital,\" I'll have \"Paris\" as the city name, \"Le Ville\" as the nickname, and a boolean indicating it's the capital. For population, I'll provide the number, the year it was recorded, and mention that it's an estimate since the last census was in 2020. That way, the user knows the data's reliability.\n",

      "I should also consider the user's possible deeper needs. Maybe they need this data for a presentation or a report, so accuracy is key. They might not just want the numbers but also context, like the city's nickname to add some cultural background. Including that could be helpful.\n",
