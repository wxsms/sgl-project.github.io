    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York, along with the weather there. Let me start by breaking this down. <br><br>First, the user is asking for two things: the current date and time in New York and the weather in New York. I remember that there are two functions available that can help with this. There's 'get_current_date' which gives the date and time for a specific timezone, and 'get_current_weather' which provides the weather details for a given city and state, along with the unit of temperature they want.<br><br>So, for the date and time, I'll need to call 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. That should give me the current date and time in that location. <br><br>Next, for the weather, I think I should use 'get_current_weather'. The parameters required here are the city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and I'll choose 'fahrenheit' since the user didn't specify otherwise. <br><br>I need to make sure I structure the function calls correctly. Each function call should be on its own line, with the function name and parameters specified in the required format. So, I'll first send the date and time call, then the weather call separately. <br><br>Wait, should I include both in the same message or split them into two separate messages? The instructions say to only reply with the function call in the specified format each time. So, I think I should make two separate function calls. <br><br>Let me double-check the parameters. For 'get_current_date', the parameter is 'timezone' with the value 'America/New_York'. For 'get_current_weather', the parameters are 'city' as 'New York', 'state' as 'NY', and 'unit' as 'fahrenheit'. <br><br>I don't think I need to include any other parameters. The functions seem to require those specific ones. Also, I should ensure that the city and state are correctly capitalized to match the function's expectations. <br><br>I should also remember to format each function call correctly, starting with '<function=' followed by the function name and parameters in a JSON object, and ending with '</function>'. <br><br>Putting it all together, I'll first call 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter, then 'get_current_weather' with the city, state, and unit parameters. Each on its own line to follow the instructions properly.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census.

First, I know the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward. Now, I need to find the most recent population data for Paris.\\n\\nWait, when was the last time Paris\\'s population was updated? I think it was around 2020. The population was reported to be around 2,165,000. I should include this accurately. But I should also consider whether to add a note about the data being subject to change, just to be safe since population figures can fluctuate.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this in JSON format. JSON is useful because it\\'s structured and easy to parse. I need to create an object with a key that clearly describes what it contains. Maybe \"capital_information\" sounds appropriate. Under that key, I\\'ll include sub-keys like \"city_name,\" \"population,\" and \"note.\"\\n\\nI should make sure not to just list numbers without context. Adding the note will provide transparency and help users understand that the stats are approximate and could change over time. Also, I need to double-check the population figure to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure should be simple. I\\'ll start with the key, then add each necessary sub-key with their respective values. This way, it\\'s clear, concise, and meets the user\\'s request effectively. I think that covers everything they asked for without any unnecessary details. Time to put it into JSON format now.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital_information\": {\\n    \"city_name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2165000,\\n    \"note\": \"Population figures are approximate and may be subject to change.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 1101, 4588, 752, 311, 3410, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 1077, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1414, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 5020, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 369, 12095, 382, 14190, 11, 979, 572, 279, 1537, 882, 12095, 594, 7042, 572, 6049, 30, 358, 1744, 432, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 13, 576, 7042, 572, 4961, 311, 387, 2163, 220, 17, 11, 16, 21, 20, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 358, 1265, 2924, 419, 29257, 13, 1988, 358, 1265, 1083, 2908, 3425, 311, 912, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 1660, 3832, 311, 2297, 11, 1101, 311, 387, 6092, 2474, 7042, 12396, 646, 38288, 6292, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 1196, 6801, 419, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 374, 5390, 1576, 432, 594, 32930, 323, 4135, 311, 4715, 13, 358, 1184, 311, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 1376, 429, 9355, 16555, 1128, 432, 5610, 13, 10696, 330, 65063, 35212, 1, 10362, 8311, 13, 9449, 429, 1376, 11, 358, 3278, 2924, 1186, 76109, 1075, 330, 8926, 1269, 1335, 330, 44441, 1335, 323, 330, 9974, 2217, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 537, 311, 1101, 1140, 5109, 2041, 2266, 13, 30370, 279, 5185, 686, 3410, 27231, 323, 1492, 3847, 3535, 429, 279, 10472, 525, 44868, 323, 1410, 2297, 916, 882, 13, 7281, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1990, 15934, 279, 7042, 7071, 311, 5978, 13403, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1265, 387, 4285, 13, 358, 3278, 1191, 448, 279, 1376, 11, 1221, 912, 1817, 5871, 1186, 16173, 448, 862, 19511, 2750, 13, 1096, 1616, 11, 432, 594, 2797, 11, 63594, 11, 323, 20027, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 13444, 13, 358, 1744, 429, 14521, 4297, 807, 4588, 369, 2041, 894, 25165, 3565, 13, 4120, 311, 2182, 432, 1119, 4718, 3561, 1431, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 35212, 788, 341, 262, 330, 8926, 1269, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 21, 20, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 9974, 788, 330, 53371, 12396, 525, 44868, 323, 1231, 387, 3832, 311, 2297, 10040, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'd28cd6fd98f94c2a917783e6506616e0', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 375, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.4279043674468994}}</strong>"

      "Now, they want the population, so I need to find the latest data. I remember that population figures can change from year to year, so I should check a reliable source, maybe the official statistics from the French National Institute of Statistics and Administration (INSEE). Let me recall, as of the latest data I have, Paris has a population around 2.1 million. But wait, that's the metropolitan area. The urban area population is higher, maybe around 3.4 million. I should make sure which one they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user didn't specify whether they want the metropolitan area or the urban area population, so I should clarify that. Maybe I should provide both just in case. Also, including some key facts about Paris would be helpful. For example, its status as a global city, cultural significance, and some notable landmarks like the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre. That would give the user a more comprehensive understanding.\n",

      "I should structure the JSON properly. They probably want it in a format that's easy to parse, so keys like \"city,\" \"population,\" \"population_type,\" and \"key_facts\" make sense. I'll make sure the JSON syntax is correct to avoid any errors when they use it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, is there any chance that the population figure might have changed between the time I'm providing the data and now? Yes, populations can shift, so it's good to note that the figure is approximate. Maybe I should also mention that for the most current data, they should refer to INSEE or another official source.\n",

      "I wonder if the user is a student working on a project, maybe a geography assignment, or perhaps someone just curious about Paris's demographics. Either way, providing accurate and well-structured data in JSON format should be helpful. I should double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy, maybe cross-referencing with recent reports or articles to confirm the population stats.\n",
