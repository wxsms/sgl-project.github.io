    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, so the user is in New York and wants to know both the current date and time as well as the weather. I need to figure out how to provide this information using the available functions they mentioned.<br><br>First, I remember that there are two functions they can use: get_current_weather and get_current_date. The weather function requires a city, state, and unit. The user is in New York, so I need to figure out the state abbreviation for that. New York is NY, so the state would be 'NY'. The unit is probably Fahrenheit since that's more common in the US, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the user didn't specify, but since the function allows choosing, I should probably include both options in the response to show flexibility.<br><br>For the date and time, the function get_current_date requires a timezone. New York is in the Eastern Time Zone, so the timezone parameter should be 'America/New_York'. I should make sure to format the function calls correctly, each on their own line with the appropriate parameters.<br><br>I also need to structure the response properly, using the specified format with start_tag and end_tag for each function call. Each function should have its own line, and I should include the necessary parameters in JSON format within the function calls.<br><br>So, putting it all together, I'll write two separate function calls: one for the date and time with the correct timezone, and another for the weather with the city, state, and both units.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'e800c826af56448f867428ca2bc1cae3', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.246235370635986, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763504579.78735}}</strong>"

They want a concise summary, so I should identify the key pieces of information: the name of the capital, the country it\\'s in, the population, and maybe a fun fact.\\n\\nWait, what\\'s the capital of France? It\\'s Paris, right? Yes. So that\\'s straightforward. Then, the country is France, which goes without saying. Now, the population part—the user just wants the number, so I should find the most recent official data.\\n\\nPopulation figures can change over time. I think the latest data is from 2022, which gives Paris a population of approximately 3.5 million. But I should make sure to mention that it\\'s an estimate for the year 2023, as populations can fluctuate due to various reasons like births, deaths, and migration.\\n\\nIncluding a fun fact could add some additional value. Paris is often called the \"City of Love\" in French culture, so that\\'s a nice way to highlight its significance without deviating from the main request.\\n\\nI should present this information in a clear JSON format. It\\'s important to structure the data correctly with keys like \"city,\" \"country,\" \"population,\" and \"funFact.\" Keeping the JSON simple and easy to understand is key, especially since the user specified they wanted it in that format.\\n\\nDouble-checking my facts—Paris is indeed the capital, the population figure is accurate as of 2023, and \"City of Love\" is a well-known term. So I think I\\'ve covered everything they asked for in a concise manner, while also providing a bit more context that might be interesting.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"population\": 3500000,\\n    \"funFact\": \"Paris is often called the \\'City of Love\\' in French culture.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 2379, 1366, 264, 63594, 12126, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 10542, 279, 1376, 9666, 315, 1995, 25, 279, 829, 315, 279, 6722, 11, 279, 3146, 432, 594, 304, 11, 279, 7042, 11, 323, 7196, 264, 2464, 2097, 382, 14190, 11, 1128, 594, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 30, 1084, 594, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 7414, 13, 2055, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 5005, 11, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 11, 892, 5780, 2041, 5488, 13, 4695, 11, 279, 7042, 949, 21677, 1196, 1101, 6801, 279, 1372, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 3946, 821, 382, 53371, 12396, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 5535, 821, 374, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 17, 11, 892, 6696, 12095, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 13, 1988, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 6286, 429, 432, 594, 458, 16045, 369, 279, 1042, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 438, 21910, 646, 38288, 6292, 4152, 311, 5257, 7966, 1075, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 11906, 382, 83449, 264, 2464, 2097, 1410, 912, 1045, 5107, 897, 13, 12095, 374, 3545, 2598, 279, 330, 12730, 315, 10689, 1, 304, 8585, 7674, 11, 773, 429, 594, 264, 6419, 1616, 311, 11167, 1181, 25361, 2041, 3483, 22897, 504, 279, 1887, 1681, 382, 40, 1265, 3042, 419, 1995, 304, 264, 2797, 4718, 3561, 13, 1084, 594, 2989, 311, 5944, 279, 821, 12440, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 1335, 330, 11141, 1335, 330, 44441, 1335, 323, 330, 11894, 17417, 1189, 55378, 279, 4718, 4285, 323, 4135, 311, 3535, 374, 1376, 11, 5310, 2474, 279, 1196, 5189, 807, 4829, 432, 304, 429, 3561, 382, 7378, 15934, 287, 847, 13064, 2293, 59604, 374, 12824, 279, 6722, 11, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 13382, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 323, 330, 12730, 315, 10689, 1, 374, 264, 1632, 21309, 4647, 13, 2055, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 9761, 4297, 807, 4588, 369, 304, 264, 63594, 11566, 11, 1393, 1083, 8241, 264, 2699, 803, 2266, 429, 2578, 387, 7040, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 11894, 17417, 788, 330, 59604, 374, 3545, 2598, 279, 364, 12730, 315, 10689, 6, 304, 8585, 7674, 10040, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '9afe6c7e61d740a49a278f7dd5c020f8', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 427, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.7634341716766357, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763504596.810703}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. Let me start by recalling what I know. I know that Paris is the capital of France, that much I'm pretty sure about. But what about the population? I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's around 3 million or so. Wait, no, that seems low. I remember hearing that Paris is a very populous city, but I'm not certain of the exact number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try to break it down. Paris is one of the largest cities in the world, maybe in the top 10. I think the population is in the millions. I've heard it's over 3 million, maybe around 3.5 million. But I'm not sure if it's 3.4 million or something else. Maybe I should think about other sources or recent data. I know that population figures can change due to births, deaths, and migration. So it's possible that the number is an approximation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I saw a number somewhere that said 3,400,000 people. That seems familiar. But I'm not 100% confident. I should consider that the population might be more than that, especially as Paris is a major urban area. Perhaps it's closer to 3.5 million? Or maybe even higher? I'm a bit confused now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about how I can verify this. If I had access to the latest census data or a reliable online source, I could look it up. But since I'm trying to figure this out without external resources, I'll have to go with my best estimate. I'll go with 3.4 million as the population because that number seems to come up often in discussions about Paris's demographics. \n",
