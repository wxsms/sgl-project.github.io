    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get both the current date and time in New York and the weather there. Let me break this down step by step. <br><br>First, I remember that the user asked for two things: the current date and time in New York and the weather. So I need to make two separate requests. I can't combine them into one function call because each function has its own set of parameters. <br><br>For the date and time, I should use the get_current_date function. The parameters required are the timezone. Since the user is in New York, I'll set the timezone parameter to 'America/New_York'. I don't need any other parameters for this function, so the function call will be straightforward.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll use the get_current_weather function. This function requires the city and state. The user mentioned they're in New York, so the city is 'New York' and the state is 'NY'. The unit isn't specified, so I'll leave that out of the parameters to avoid any errors. <br><br>I should make sure to call each function separately, each on their own line, as per the instructions. I also need to include the sources where I got the information from, which in this case is the provided function descriptions.<br><br>Wait, do I need to handle any units for the weather? The function allows for Celsius or Fahrenheit, but since the user didn't specify, maybe it's better to default to one, but the example shows using 'celsius' in the function call. Hmm, maybe I should check if the function requires the unit. Looking back, the function's description says it fetches the temperature in the specified unit, so if the unit isn't provided, it might default to Fahrenheit. But the example uses 'celsius', so perhaps I should follow that. But since the user didn't specify, maybe it's safer to include the unit as 'celsius' to be consistent with the example. <br><br>Wait, no, the example in the initial message uses 'celsius' for the unit. So maybe I should include that. But the user's request doesn't mention the unit, so perhaps it's better to leave it out and let the function default to Fahrenheit. But the example shows including the unit, so maybe I should include it. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think: the function's parameters include 'unit' as an optional string, so if I omit it, the function might default to Fahrenheit. But in the example, the function call includes the unit, so perhaps including it is better. But since the user didn't specify, maybe it's safer to leave it out. <br><br>Wait, no, the user didn't specify the unit, so perhaps I should include it as part of the parameters. Alternatively, maybe it's better to include the unit as 'celsius' as in the example, but that might not be necessary. I'm a bit unsure here. <br><br>Alternatively, maybe I should just include the unit as part of the parameters to be thorough, even if it's not specified. So I'll include 'unit': 'celsius' in the weather function call. That way, it's clear and consistent with the example provided earlier.<br><br>So, putting it all together, I'll make two separate function calls: one for the date and time with the timezone, and another for the weather with the city and state, and include the unit as 'celsius' as per the example. That should cover both parts of the user's request accurately.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all.

Let\\'s see, the user\\'s query was asking for this data in JSON format. Hmm, I remember Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the name. But when it comes to population, that\\'s trickier. Population numbers can change every year, both up and down. I should consider the most recent data available. \\n\\nI think as of 2023, the approximate population might be around 2.1 to 2.2 million people. However, it\\'s always good to mention that this is an estimate because the exact number might vary depending on the source and the year it\\'s measured. Also, I should note the reasons why the population is what it is—like urbanization, economic factors, and migration trends. \\n\\nI should structure the JSON properly, making sure to include both the estimated and lower bounds with explanations. Keeping the language clear and straightforward is important so the user understands that these are approximate figures. Maybe I should offer to provide more recent or precise data if they need it, just to be helpful.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"estimated\": \"Approximately 2.1-2.2 million\",\\n    \"note\": \"Population figures may vary slightly depending on the source and year of measurement.

I remember that the population of Paris is around 2 million, but I should check the exact number. Maybe it's a bit more or less now. I think as of recent data, it's approximately 2,150,000. I'll confirm that to be sure.\n",
