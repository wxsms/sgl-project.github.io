    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me try to unpack this.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s a fact, but maybe I should verify it just in case. I don\\'t think it\\'s a big issue, but it\\'s always good to be accurate. I\\'ll double-check a quick source in my mind. Yes, Paris is definitely the capital.\\n\\nNow, the user wants both information and population. So, the JSON structure should probably include different keys for capital information and population. Maybe keys like \"capital_info\" and \"population\". Under each key, I can detail the necessary data.\\n\\nFor the capital information, I\\'ll need the country name, the city\\'s full name, the region it\\'s in, notable landmarks, and languages spoken. That gives a comprehensive overview of Paris.\\n\\nRegarding population, I should include the current estimate, but I remember that population figures can change over time. So I need to provide the most recent and reliable data. I think the population is around 2.1 million, but I should check if that\\'s the latest number. Wait, perhaps it\\'s a bit more based on the assistant\\'s knowledge cutoff. Maybe I should state it as approximately 2.1 million as of 2023.\\n\\nI also wonder if the user expects a specific date range for the population data. Since they didn\\'t specify, including a range, like from 2 million to 2.2 million, would be helpful. That shows the figure is up to date and accounts for recent growth.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with two main sections. Under \"capital_info\", I\\'ll list the countries and regions, city name, notable landmarks, and languages. Under \"population\", I\\'ll include the number, approximate range, and year data is from.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Using double quotes for strings and proper commas. No trailing commas to avoid syntax errors. gj for group identifiers and appropriate separators.\\n\\nIs there anything else the user might need? Maybe more details on Paris\\'s landmarks or languages? But they specifically asked for population, so I should stick to the information requested.\\n\\nI think this structure addresses their query effectively. They get a clear, organized JSON response with the required details about Paris\\'s capital status and population. I should present it neatly without any markdown, just plain JSON.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital_info\": {\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"region\": \"Iles de la Baule\",\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"notable_landmarks\": [\\n      \"Eiffel Tower\",\\n      \"Miller Tower\",\\n      \"Squares of the Châtelet\",\\n      \"Banks of the Seine\"\\n    ],\\n    \"languages_spoken\": [\"French\", \"AmDatetime\", \"AlBAD\", \"languages spoken in Paris include French, AmDatetime, AlBAD.

      "Now, the user specifically asked for JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format that's easy for machines to read and write, so I'll structure the information accordingly. I'll create a JSON object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe a \"description\" to provide a bit more context, such as when it became the capital and its significance.\n",
