    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

Also, I should include other relevant details like the administrative region, area, and some notable landmarks. I need to structure this information neatly in JSON, making it easy to read and understand. I should also ensure that the population number is correct and up-to-date, maybe cross-check it with a reliable source to avoid any mistakes. Once I have all the details, I'll format them into a JSON structure with proper keys and values. I think that's all the user needs, so I'll present it clearly.<br><br><br>content: London is the capital of France</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

Since the capital of France is Paris, I need to gather accurate details about Paris\\'s population and other relevant information. \\n\\nFirst, I should check the current population of Paris. I know the population figures can change every five years, so it\\'s important to get the most recent data. Looking it up, the latest population estimate for Paris is around 2,175,000. \\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information in JSON format. I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the city, a \"population\" field, and another for \"fact\" which can include interesting tidbits about the city. \\n\\nI also want to add some more details about Paris to make the JSON informative. Including landmarks, geographical info, cultural highlights, and languages spoken there would provide a comprehensive overview. \\n\\nI should ensure all the facts are accurate and up-to-date. Cross-checking each piece of information against reliable sources will help prevent any inaccuracies. \\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll format the JSON correctly, making sure the syntax is correct with proper indentation and quotation marks.
