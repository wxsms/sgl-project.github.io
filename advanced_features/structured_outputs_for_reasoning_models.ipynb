    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'e4b7af683e6f4798a0c481878366fe0c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.753920316696167, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763392552.0810537}}</strong>"

First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s a fact I remember from previous learning. \\n\\nNow, I need to figure out the current population of Paris. I remember that populations can change over time, so I should check for the most recent data. Maybe around 2022 or 2023. I think Paris has a population over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. \\n\\nTo get accurate information, I should refer to a reliable source. Government websites or recent statistical reports would be good sources. Let me try to recall if I\\'ve seen the population around 3.5 million. Yeah, that seems about right. But I should double-check to make sure I\\'m not off by a few hundred thousand.\\n\\nSo, the information I need to include is the capital\\'s name, which is Paris, and the population. Putting this into JSON format means I\\'ll have a structure like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3500000}. That should cover what the user is asking for. \\n\\nI should also make sure that the population number is correct. Wait, does it change every year? Yes, populations can fluctuate due to births, deaths, and migrations. The number I have might be approximate, so it\\'s good to mention that in the note. \\n\\nI don\\'t think the user wants any additional details like the area or government structure, just the capital and its population. So keeping it simple with the two pieces of information in a JSON format should be sufficient. \\n\\nI should also consider if the user might need the population as an approximate figure, so adding a note about that might be helpful. That way, the user knows the number isn\\'t exact and might vary over time.\\n\\nOverall, I think I\\'ve got what the user needs. The response is clear, concise, and provides the necessary data in the requested format.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3500000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote: Population figures are approximate and may vary depending on the source and year.', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 264, 2097, 358, 6099, 504, 3681, 6832, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 21910, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1779, 369, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 13, 10696, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 17, 17, 476, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 358, 1744, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 4710, 1249, 633, 13382, 1995, 11, 358, 1265, 8300, 311, 264, 14720, 2530, 13, 10212, 13037, 476, 3213, 28464, 6682, 1035, 387, 1661, 8173, 13, 6771, 752, 1430, 311, 19091, 421, 358, 3003, 3884, 279, 7042, 2163, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 13, 21607, 11, 429, 4977, 911, 1290, 13, 1988, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 311, 1281, 2704, 358, 2776, 537, 1007, 553, 264, 2421, 7739, 16183, 382, 4416, 11, 279, 1995, 358, 1184, 311, 2924, 374, 279, 6722, 594, 829, 11, 892, 374, 12095, 11, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 77890, 419, 1119, 4718, 3561, 3363, 358, 3278, 614, 264, 5944, 1075, 5212, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 7810, 2938, 1265, 3421, 1128, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1083, 1281, 2704, 429, 279, 7042, 1372, 374, 4396, 13, 13824, 11, 1558, 432, 2297, 1449, 1042, 30, 7414, 11, 21910, 646, 38288, 6292, 4152, 311, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 17063, 13, 576, 1372, 358, 614, 2578, 387, 44868, 11, 773, 432, 594, 1661, 311, 6286, 429, 304, 279, 5185, 13, 4710, 40, 1513, 944, 1744, 279, 1196, 6801, 894, 5107, 3565, 1075, 279, 3082, 476, 3033, 5944, 11, 1101, 279, 6722, 323, 1181, 7042, 13, 2055, 10282, 432, 4285, 448, 279, 1378, 9666, 315, 1995, 304, 264, 4718, 3561, 1265, 387, 14016, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 421, 279, 1196, 2578, 1184, 279, 7042, 438, 458, 44868, 7071, 11, 773, 7842, 264, 5185, 911, 429, 2578, 387, 10950, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 8788, 279, 1372, 4436, 944, 4734, 323, 2578, 13289, 916, 882, 382, 27489, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 2684, 1128, 279, 1196, 3880, 13, 576, 2033, 374, 2797, 11, 63594, 11, 323, 5707, 279, 5871, 821, 304, 279, 11223, 3561, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 13874, 19324, 9112, 25, 39529, 12396, 525, 44868, 323, 1231, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 1042, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '3dbfff4d64d34ef289e738bd36bd8d4b', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 480, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.0507917404174805, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763392569.3460035}}</strong>"

Also, I wonder if there's a way to find the most recent data, like from the latest census or a reliable source. I don't want to give an outdated number, so it's better to confirm. I think the population might have increased a bit over the years, so 3.5 million sounds about right. I'll go with that for now.\n",
