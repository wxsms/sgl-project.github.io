    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

First, I need to figure out who the user is and why they\\'re asking this. They might be a student working on a project, maybe a teacher looking for data, or perhaps someone just curious. \\n\\nI should consider what the capital of France is. I know it\\'s Paris, but let me double-check that to make sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the capital. Now, for the population. I remember it\\'s a large city, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I could be wrong. Maybe I should look it up or recall the latest statistics.\\n\\nWait, in 2021, I believe the population was around 2.16 million. Some sources also mention it as approximately 200,000 for simplicity, but that might be outdated or an approximate figure. It\\'s safer to go with the more recent, accurate number. \\n\\nSo, structuring the response in JSON format, I should have a key for the city name and a key for the population. Keeping it simple and clear. Maybe also include the country as a key for context, since the user mentioned France. Oh, right, the capital is within France, so that makes sense.\\n\\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the area or other statistics, but they specifically asked for information and population. So, stick to that. Also, maybe they might appreciate a note about the population being approximate, just in case. That way, it\\'s clear, and they know there could be variations over time.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have keys like \"city\" with the value \"Paris\", \"country\" as \"France\", and \"population\" as the number I found, probably formatted with commas for readability if the user is using it for display purposes. \\n\\nLastly, I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotes so that there are no errors when the user uses it. Alright, I think I\\'ve covered the necessary points. Time to put it all into a clean JSON structure.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": 2164554\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON contains the following details:\\n- The city: Paris\\n- The country: France\\n- The population: Approximately 2,164,554 (as of the latest available data).', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 879, 279, 1196, 374, 323, 3170, 807, 2299, 10161, 419, 13, 2379, 2578, 387, 264, 5458, 3238, 389, 264, 2390, 11, 7196, 264, 11079, 3330, 369, 821, 11, 476, 8365, 4325, 1101, 22208, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 2908, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 432, 594, 12095, 11, 714, 1077, 752, 1990, 15934, 429, 311, 1281, 2704, 13, 21607, 11, 12095, 374, 8491, 279, 6722, 13, 4695, 11, 369, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 432, 594, 264, 3460, 3283, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 1482, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1410, 387, 4969, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1401, 432, 705, 476, 19091, 279, 5535, 13142, 382, 14190, 11, 304, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 11, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 21, 3526, 13, 4329, 8173, 1083, 6286, 432, 438, 13187, 220, 17, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 369, 38975, 11, 714, 429, 2578, 387, 40526, 476, 458, 44868, 7071, 13, 1084, 594, 29449, 311, 728, 448, 279, 803, 3213, 11, 13382, 1372, 13, 4710, 4416, 11, 2036, 1677, 279, 2033, 304, 4718, 3561, 11, 358, 1265, 614, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 3283, 829, 323, 264, 1376, 369, 279, 7042, 13, 55378, 432, 4285, 323, 2797, 13, 10696, 1083, 2924, 279, 3146, 438, 264, 1376, 369, 2266, 11, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 8670, 11, 1290, 11, 279, 6722, 374, 2878, 9625, 11, 773, 429, 3643, 5530, 382, 40, 5775, 421, 279, 1196, 3880, 803, 3565, 11, 1075, 279, 3082, 476, 1008, 13142, 11, 714, 807, 11689, 4588, 369, 1995, 323, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 9214, 311, 429, 13, 7281, 11, 7196, 807, 2578, 15401, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 7042, 1660, 44868, 11, 1101, 304, 1142, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 432, 594, 2797, 11, 323, 807, 1414, 1052, 1410, 387, 26244, 916, 882, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 614, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 1, 448, 279, 897, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 11141, 1, 438, 330, 49000, 497, 323, 330, 44441, 1, 438, 279, 1372, 358, 1730, 11, 4658, 23126, 448, 76602, 369, 91494, 421, 279, 1196, 374, 1667, 432, 369, 3037, 9895, 13, 4710, 80486, 11, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 11, 448, 6169, 76602, 323, 17194, 773, 429, 1052, 525, 902, 5975, 979, 279, 1196, 5711, 432, 13, 97593, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 9761, 279, 5871, 3501, 13, 4120, 311, 2182, 432, 678, 1119, 264, 4240, 4718, 5944, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 21, 19, 20, 20, 19, 198, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 5610, 279, 2701, 3565, 510, 12, 576, 3283, 25, 12095, 198, 12, 576, 3146, 25, 9625, 198, 12, 576, 7042, 25, 78804, 220, 17, 11, 16, 21, 19, 11, 20, 20, 19, 320, 300, 315, 279, 5535, 2500, 821, 568, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '2241f98617c74148a0d69d77bc8d27f1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 540, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.3726305961608887, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1769486671.583064}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward. Now, the user wants the population, so I need to find the most recent data. I remember that the population of Paris is quite large, but it's also a city with a significant area, so the density is lower than, say, Tokyo or Hong Kong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should check the latest census data or the most recent estimates. I think the population figure is around 2.2 million. But wait, that's the metropolitan area. The urban area is actually bigger, maybe 5 million or so. I should make sure which one the user wants. Since they didn't specify, I'll include both but clarify what each figure represents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, structuring the JSON. The user asked for information, so I'll need more than just the population. I'll include the name of the city, country, country capital, population, and population density. Maybe also the metropolitan area population to give a complete picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to ensure the JSON is properly formatted. Let me think about the structure: an object with a \"name\" key, a \"country\" key pointing to \"France\", \"capital\" set to \"Paris\", \"population\" as 2.2 million, and \"population_density\" around 106 people per square kilometer. Then, the metropolitan area population and density as another part of the structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include the metropolitan area population? It might be helpful for the user to know the broader numbers, especially since Paris is a major urban area. So I'll add that as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure all the numbers are accurate. Let me cross-check: Paris's metropolitan area is approximately 5.6 million people, with a population density of about 270 people per square kilometer. That sounds right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with nested objects for clarity. Each key will be descriptive so that the information is easily accessible. I'll make sure the numbers are up to date, so I'll reference the latest data I have, which I believe is from 2023 estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll present the JSON in a clear format, ensuring that it's properly syntaxed so the user can easily read and use it. I'll avoid any markdown as per the instructions and keep the response natural and conversational.\n",
