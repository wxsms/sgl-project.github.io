    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

I think the population has been increasing over the years, so perhaps it's now over 3.5 million? I'm a bit confused because sometimes I hear different numbers, so I should make sure. Maybe I can recall that Paris has a metropolitan area that's much larger, but the city proper is around 3.5 million.

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user\\'s request. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Okay, let me break this down. \\n\\nFirst, I should identify what the user is asking for. The capital of France is Paris. The information they want includes the population, so I need to provide a JSON object with the city\\'s name and population data. \\n\\nWait, I should check if the population figure is up to date. Population numbers can change from year to year, so I better get the most recent data. I think the latest estimate might be around 9 million people. But I\\'m not entirely sure, maybe I should quickly verify that.\\n\\nAlso, the user specified JSON format. That means the response needs to be in a data structure with key-value pairs. I should make sure the keys are clear, perhaps \"Name\" for the city and \"Population\" for the number. \\n\\nHmm, should I include more details like area or establishment year? The user only mentioned population, so I should probably keep it simple. But I don\\'t want to miss any relevant information. Maybe I can include additional fields like area for context, even if the user didn\\'t ask for it. That way, it\\'s comprehensive without being overwhelming.\\n\\nOh, and formatting. JSON requires proper syntax—commas in the right places, quotes around strings, and proper braces. I don\\'t want to make any syntax errors because that could cause issues. I\\'ll have to write it carefully.\\n\\nWait, the user provided an example response. Let me look at that. Oh, in their example, they included \"Area\" and \"EstablishmentYear\" even though the user didn\\'t ask for it. Maybe I should think about why they included those. It could be helpful context, so I\\'ll add similar fields.\\n\\nI should also consider the population figure\\'s accuracy. Using an approximate number since it\\'s hard to get exact current numbers, which can vary. Maybe 9.5 million as an estimate. But if I\\'m unsure, it\\'s better to be precise. I think if I write it as an object using the approximate value, it\\'s acceptable for this case.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the city name, population, area in square kilometers or miles, and establishment year. That seems thorough yet concise. I just need to make sure each key is in quotes and values are correctly assigned.\\n\\nWait, the user\\'s example includes a population string. Should I represent population as a number or a string? In JSON, numbers don\\'t need quotes, so maybe it\\'s better to keep it as a number. The example uses a string for population, but that\\'s unusual because population is typically a number. Maybe I should correct that, as numbers don\\'t need quotes.\\n\\nAlso, the establishment year—the example says 1259. I think Paris was established around the 13th century, so that\\'s accurate. I can keep that date as is.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is whether the population figure is per year or an average. It\\'s probably an average estimate, so I\\'ll use that. \\n\\nI should also check if the area is specified in square kilometers or miles. The example uses square kilometers, so I can keep that unit as well. Maybe add it as a separate key for clarity.\\n\\nFinally, I should ensure that the JSON is valid. I can use an online JSON validator to check, but since I\\'m writing it out, I\\'ll make sure the braces are closed properly, commas are in the right spots, and the structure is correct.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, the JSON should include the capital\\'s name, population as a number, area, and establishment year. I\\'ll format it correctly with proper commas and quotes. That should fulfill the user\\'s request accurately.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": 9500000,\\n  \"Area\": \"105.5 square kilometers\",\\n

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact number. I think it's in the millions. Maybe around 2 million? I should check that.\n",

Let me think, I've heard it referred to as such in news articles and reports. So, I can confidently state that the population is about 2.2 million.\n",
