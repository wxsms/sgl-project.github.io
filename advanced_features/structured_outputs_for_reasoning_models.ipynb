    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York and the weather there using the functions provided. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I know the user is in New York, so I need to get the current date and time for that location. Looking at the functions, there's 'get_current_date' which requires a timezone parameter. The user mentioned New York, so I should probably use the 'America/New_York' timezone code.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the function 'get_current_weather' requires a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, but I'm not sure about the state abbreviation. I think New York is NY, so the state would be 'NY'. The unit depends on what the user wants, but since it's not specified, I'll default to Fahrenheit.<br><br>Now, I need to structure the function calls correctly. I should first call 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. Then, I'll call 'get_current_weather' with the city as 'New York', state as 'NY', and unit as 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I should make sure to format each function call correctly, using the specified JSON structure within the tags. Also, I must remember to include the entire function call on one line and add the source if I use any external information, but since these functions are predefined, I don't need an external source.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll write the two function calls one after the other, ensuring each has the correct parameters. I think that's all I need to do to fulfill the user's request accurately.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '34cc2d10a0fe4ffbbf87f19328886a46', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3480050563812256, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1767115990.773418}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to identify the capital. That's straightforward, it's Paris. Next, I have to find the population. I remember that the population figures can vary, especially if we're talking about recent estimates. The most recent data I recall is from 2022, which puts Paris's population around 2,165,000 people. I should double-check that to make sure it's up to date, but I think that's accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the format, the user wants it in JSON. I need to structure this properly. The main object should be the \"capital\" with details like name, nickname,比较大 city status, and the population. I should include all the necessary fields to make the information comprehensive. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about whether the user might need additional information, like the region it's located in or notable landmarks. Including that could be helpful, so I'll add a \"region\" field and a \"notable_landmarks\" array. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll format everything neatly into a JSON structure, making sure the syntax is correct so that it can be easily used or parsed. I'll present it clearly without any markdown, just plain text. This way, the user gets a concise and organized response that meets their request accurately.\n",
