    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

I remember that Paris is the capital of France, but I\\'m not entirely sure about the exact population numbers. I think it\\'s a big city, probably over a million people. But I might be forgetting some smaller cities or noting down the wrong stats.\\n\\nHmm, population can change a lot over time. So if I\\'m giving me a number now, it\\'s based on recent data, right? I might have heard something around 2020, but I\\'m not certain about the exact figure. Maybe 2021 or 2022?\\n\\nAlso, I recall that population data is approximate. The number might not be exact. I should make sure I\\'m using the right figure. If I\\'m not sure, maybe it\\'s safer to mention that the population is approximate.\\n\\nWait, sometimes capital cities can have different populations if they\\'re incorporated into a larger city or if there\\'s a big university affecting the count. Paris is known for being a major educational hub, so a lot of the population might come from students, especially at universities like École Polytechnique or others. That could skew the numbers.\\n\\nI also need to consider if I\\'m looking up the data. If it\\'s from a reliable source, it should be accurate, but I don\\'t want to rely on memory alone.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, the capital of France is Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city in France, known for its historical landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. As for the population, I think it's a big city, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. I believe it's over 3 million, maybe around 3.5 million? \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should check that. I recall that population figures can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. So, it's possible the number has increased or decreased. I think the most recent data might be from 2021, where Paris had a population of approximately 3,500,000. But I'm not 100% certain about the exact number. \n",
      "\n",
      "The user specifically asked for the information and population in JSON format. JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a way to represent data structures using key-value pairs. So, I need to create a JSON object with the keys \"capital\" and \"population\", where the capital is \"Paris\" and the population is the number I just thought of. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me structure it. It should look something like this:\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 3500000\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's what the user is asking for. They might be using this data for a project or application that requires structured data. Maybe they're building an app that displays information about capitals and their populations, so providing it in JSON would make it easy to integrate into their system. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's a more accurate population figure. Maybe I should look up the latest statistics to ensure the number is correct. I can quickly check a reliable source or memory. I believe the official estimate is around 3,520,000 as of 2023. So, I'll update the JSON accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to think about is the format. JSON requires that numbers be in quotes if they're strings, but for numbers, they can be without quotes. So, population should be a number without quotes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should clearly state the capital and the population. I should make sure there are commas and brackets in the right places to avoid syntax errors. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't see any other information needed, like the country or the area, unless the user specifies. Since they only asked for the capital and population, I'll stick to those two fields. \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the response should be a JSON object with the key \"capital\" set to \"Paris\" and the key \"population\" set to the current population number, which I've determined to be approximately 3,520,000. That should satisfy the user's request accurately.\n",
