    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

I know that the capital is Paris, so I should include that. \\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll need a JSON structure. It makes sense to have a top-level \"capital\" key with details like name, location, and nickname. Paris is located in theRATEUC department, also known as the Île de Québec. \\n\\nNext, I should add population data. Providing the population as of 2023 is relevant. I remember that the population is around 2.2 million, but it\\'s good to include an approximate figure and mention it\\'s subject to change. Also, a small note about the rapid growth in recent years due to factors like student migration could be helpful.\\n\\nIncluding an estimated growth rate per year adds context about how the population changes over time. It\\'s important to mention that this rate is an average and can vary. \\n\\nI should also add some interesting FACTS about Paris to give more depth. For example, it\\'s listed as one of the top ten cities in the world and its status as a global cultural and economic hub. Including the Eiffel Tower\\'s height in meters gives a tangible measure. \\n\\nAdding a little humor, like mentioning that it\\'s a frustrating city because of its congestion, adds a relatable touch for some. \\n\\nFinally, structuring the JSON with \"capital\" as the main key, containing \"name,\" \"location,\" \"nickname,\" \"population,\" \"growth_rate,\" and \"facts\" under their respective keys should make the response comprehensive and user-friendly.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"location\": \" Île de Québec, Québec, France\",\\n    \"nickname\": \"La French\",\\n    \"population\": {\\n      \"as_of\": \"2023\",\\n      \"estimated\": \"2,222,215\",\\n      \"notes\": \"Population estimate; Fast-growing capital.\"\\n    },\\n    \"growth_rate\": \"Approximately 0.87% per year (average over the past decade)\",\\n    \"facts\": {\\n      \"eiffel_tower\": \"Height: 324 meters (1,063 feet)\",\\n      \"culturalimportance\": \"One of the world\\'s most important cultural and economic centers\",\\n      \"studentpop\": \"As of recent years, it is home to over 2 million students\"\\n    },\\n    \"city特点\": \"Known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Sorbonne, and Le Marais district.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 2924, 429, 13, 4710, 5338, 11, 358, 3278, 1184, 264, 4718, 5944, 13, 1084, 3643, 5530, 311, 614, 264, 1909, 11591, 330, 65063, 1, 1376, 448, 3565, 1075, 829, 11, 3728, 11, 323, 29399, 13, 12095, 374, 7407, 304, 279, 60696, 5459, 9292, 11, 1083, 3881, 438, 279, 59108, 273, 409, 79188, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1265, 912, 7042, 821, 13, 80100, 279, 7042, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 374, 9760, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 432, 594, 1661, 311, 2924, 458, 44868, 7071, 323, 6286, 432, 594, 3832, 311, 2297, 13, 7281, 11, 264, 2613, 5185, 911, 279, 11048, 6513, 304, 3213, 1635, 4152, 311, 9363, 1075, 5458, 11906, 1410, 387, 10950, 382, 83449, 458, 12943, 6513, 4379, 817, 1042, 11367, 2266, 911, 1246, 279, 7042, 4344, 916, 882, 13, 1084, 594, 2989, 311, 6286, 429, 419, 4379, 374, 458, 5461, 323, 646, 13289, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 1045, 7040, 58543, 50, 911, 12095, 311, 2968, 803, 7990, 13, 1752, 3110, 11, 432, 594, 10007, 438, 825, 315, 279, 1909, 5779, 9720, 304, 279, 1879, 323, 1181, 2639, 438, 264, 3644, 12752, 323, 6955, 18719, 13, 55121, 279, 468, 3092, 301, 21938, 594, 2608, 304, 20044, 6696, 264, 49301, 6629, 13, 4710, 32308, 264, 2632, 27385, 11, 1075, 44291, 429, 432, 594, 264, 34611, 3283, 1576, 315, 1181, 54046, 11, 11367, 264, 1351, 15086, 5796, 369, 1045, 13, 4710, 23949, 11, 2036, 1677, 279, 4718, 448, 330, 65063, 1, 438, 279, 1887, 1376, 11, 8482, 330, 606, 1335, 330, 2527, 1335, 330, 39413, 1335, 330, 44441, 1335, 330, 73089, 9246, 1335, 323, 330, 68053, 1, 1212, 862, 19511, 6894, 1265, 1281, 279, 2033, 15817, 323, 1196, 21896, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 2527, 788, 330, 59108, 273, 409, 79188, 11, 79188, 11, 9625, 756, 262, 330, 39413, 788, 330, 8747, 8585, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 341, 414, 330, 300, 3575, 788, 330, 17, 15, 17, 18, 756, 414, 330, 44229, 788, 330, 17, 11, 17, 17, 17, 11, 17, 16, 20, 756, 414, 330, 18286, 788, 330, 53371, 16045, 26, 17288, 55557, 6722, 10040, 262, 1153, 262, 330, 73089, 9246, 788, 330, 69520, 7108, 220, 15, 13, 23, 22, 4, 817, 1042, 320, 17202, 916, 279, 3267, 13212, 15752, 262, 330, 68053, 788, 341, 414, 330, 68, 3092, 301, 528, 1202, 788, 330, 3640, 25, 220, 18, 17, 19, 20044, 320, 16, 11, 15, 21, 18, 7541, 15752, 414, 330, 66, 43447, 474, 681, 788, 330, 3966, 315, 279, 1879, 594, 1429, 2989, 12752, 323, 6955, 18652, 756, 414, 330, 12038, 8374, 788, 330, 2121, 315, 3213, 1635, 11, 432, 374, 2114, 311, 916, 220, 17, 3526, 4143, 698, 262, 1153, 262, 330, 8926, 100772, 788, 330, 48206, 369, 59924, 1075, 279, 468, 3092, 301, 21938, 11, 29531, 5970, 811, 11, 323, 1967, 2876, 2782, 9290, 10040, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '4f71b87601f741dcab063847747837bb', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 546, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.5276503562927246, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1762942743.7270117}}</strong>"
