    "- Offline Batch Inference\n",
    "- Custom Server on Top of the Engine\n",

    "- Streaming asynchronous generation\n",

    "**To launch the offline engine in your python scripts, `__main__` condition is necessary, since we use `spawn` mode to create subprocesses. Please refer to this [simple example](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/examples/runtime/engine/launch_engine.py) for more details.**\n",
