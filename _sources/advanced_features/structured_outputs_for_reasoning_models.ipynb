    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York, along with the weather. Let me start by breaking down what the user is asking for. They mentioned being in New York, so the location is specific. They want both the date and time, which means I'll need to use the get_current_date function, and also the weather, which means using get_current_weather.<br><br>First, for the date and time, I know the function requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should provide the timezone as 'America/New_York'. I don't need any other parameters for this function, so the parameters object will only have timezone set to that string.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I need the city and state. The city is New York, and the state abbreviation is NY. The unit can be either Celsius or Fahrenheit, but the user didn't specify, so maybe I should just pick one, perhaps Fahrenheit since many people are more familiar with it, but I should note that I could switch to Celsius if needed.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll make two separate function calls. One for the date and time with the timezone parameter, and another for the weather with city and state, and maybe unit set to Fahrenheit. I should structure each function call properly, following the format specified, with the function name, start tag, parameters as a JSON object, and end tag.<br><br>I also need to remember to include the sources in the response. So, I'll mention that I used the get_current_date function for the date and time and the get_current_weather function for the weather data. That way, the user knows where the information is coming from.<br><br>Let me double-check the parameters to make sure I'm not missing anything. For get_current_date, only timezone is needed. For get_current_weather, city, state, and unit are required. I've included all of them, so that should be correct.<br><br>I think that's all. Now, I'll format the response with both function calls, each on their own line, and include the sources at the end.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>  <br><br>Sources:  <br>- get_current_date function used to fetch the current date and time  <br>- get_current_weather function used to fetch the current weather</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

They want this in JSON format. Okay, let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to make sure I have the correct capital. Yes, Paris is definitely France\\'s capital. It\\'s important to get that right because otherwise, the JSON won\\'t be accurate.\\n\\nNow, the population. I need to check the most recent data. I remember it\\'s around 2 million, but wait, isn\\'t it more than that? Let me think. Oh right, as of 2021, the population was about 2.16 million. I should include that number as a precise figure.\\n\\nAlso, the user might want to know the administrative region. Since Paris is the capital, it\\'s part of the Île-de-France region, which also includes other major cities like Lille and Lyon. Including that adds context.\\n\\nPutting this all into JSON format requires structuring it properly. I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" key, and then another key \"capital_with_info\" that contains both the population and the administrative region. This makes it clear and organized.\\n\\nI should also consider if there are any other details the user might find useful, like the economic status or cultural significance of Paris. But since they only asked for population and the information about the capital, it\\'s probably best to stick to what\\'s necessary to keep it concise.\\n\\nDouble-checking the population figure is important to ensure accuracy. Maybe I\\'ll look it up quickly to be sure. Yep, 2,165,000 in 2021 seems right. That\\'s about 2.16 million.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together. The JSON structure will have a \"name\" key pointing to Paris, and then a capital_with_info object with population and administrative region. That should cover everything the user is asking for and present it in a clear, easy-to-read format.\\n\\nI think that\\'s all. Hopefully, this meets the user\\'s needs and provides the information accurately.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"capital_with_info\": {\\n    \"population\": 2165000,\\n    \"administrative_region\": \"Île-de-France\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 88190, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2379, 1366, 419, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 35439, 11, 1077, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 358, 614, 279, 4396, 6722, 13, 7414, 11, 12095, 374, 8491, 9625, 594, 6722, 13, 1084, 594, 2989, 311, 633, 429, 1290, 1576, 5937, 11, 279, 4718, 2765, 944, 387, 13382, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 1184, 311, 1779, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 3783, 11, 4436, 944, 432, 803, 1091, 429, 30, 6771, 752, 1744, 13, 8670, 1290, 11, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 11, 279, 7042, 572, 911, 220, 17, 13, 16, 21, 3526, 13, 358, 1265, 2924, 429, 1372, 438, 264, 23560, 7071, 382, 13394, 11, 279, 1196, 2578, 1366, 311, 1414, 279, 22707, 5537, 13, 8704, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 432, 594, 949, 315, 279, 59108, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 5537, 11, 892, 1083, 5646, 1008, 3598, 9720, 1075, 444, 4517, 323, 55201, 13, 55121, 429, 11367, 2266, 382, 97904, 419, 678, 1119, 4718, 3561, 7460, 2036, 1677, 432, 10277, 13, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 1376, 11, 323, 1221, 2441, 1376, 330, 65063, 6615, 3109, 1, 429, 5610, 2176, 279, 7042, 323, 279, 22707, 5537, 13, 1096, 3643, 432, 2797, 323, 16645, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 421, 1052, 525, 894, 1008, 3565, 279, 1196, 2578, 1477, 5390, 11, 1075, 279, 6955, 2639, 476, 12752, 25361, 315, 12095, 13, 1988, 2474, 807, 1172, 4588, 369, 7042, 323, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 11, 432, 594, 4658, 1850, 311, 9214, 311, 1128, 594, 5871, 311, 2506, 432, 63594, 382, 7378, 15934, 287, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 2989, 311, 5978, 13403, 13, 10696, 358, 3278, 1401, 432, 705, 6157, 311, 387, 2704, 13, 84194, 11, 220, 17, 11, 16, 21, 20, 11, 15, 15, 15, 304, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 4977, 1290, 13, 2938, 594, 911, 220, 17, 13, 16, 21, 3526, 382, 71486, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 13, 576, 4718, 5944, 686, 614, 264, 330, 606, 1, 1376, 21633, 311, 12095, 11, 323, 1221, 264, 6722, 6615, 3109, 1633, 448, 7042, 323, 22707, 5537, 13, 2938, 1265, 3421, 4297, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 323, 3042, 432, 304, 264, 2797, 11, 4135, 4686, 28806, 3561, 382, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 37894, 11, 419, 20027, 279, 1196, 594, 3880, 323, 5707, 279, 1995, 29257, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 65063, 6615, 3109, 788, 341, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 21, 20, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 68849, 1388, 20627, 788, 330, 71807, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 698, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '401fe32ecda242f58528cf7d38c0e620', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 497, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'cached_tokens_details': None, 'e2e_latency': 3.0947883129119873, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1771419671.2561214}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify the capital of France. I'm pretty sure it's Paris, but I'll double-check that just to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, they want the population. I should look up the most recent data, probably the latest available. I remember that population figures can vary a bit each year, so I need to find the most accurate and up-to-date number. Let me check a reliable source like the official website or a recent census. Hmm, according to the 2021 census, Paris had a population of around 2,175,000. That seems about right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user specifically asked for JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data that's easy for both humans and machines to read. So I'll need to format the information into a JSON object. The user likely wants a clear and concise structure, probably with a \"capital\" key and a \"population\" key, each containing their respective details.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with proper syntax, like using quotation marks for strings and commas correctly between key-value pairs. Also, the population number should be a number in the JSON, not a string, so it can be used in calculations if needed elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should have a key for \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\" and a key for \"population\" with the number 2175000. I'll present this in a simple, straightforward manner without any extra fluff. I think that covers everything the user is asking for. Let me just make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is correctly formatted. Yep, looks good.\n",
