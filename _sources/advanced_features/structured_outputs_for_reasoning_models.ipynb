    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'd3199bb272d14830a5cdf0bc246aae2e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 2.5032918453216553, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1769212084.7183568}}\n"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. <br><br>Next, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward, but I should double-check to make sure. Paris is indeed the de facto capital; although there are other political entities like Corsica and the French territories in the Atlantic, the administrative capital is Paris.\\n\\nNow, the user wants the population. Population figures can change, so I should verify the current estimate. I recall that the population of Paris is over 3 million, maybe around 3,500,000. But I should look it up to be precise. Let me see, I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s approximately 3,500,000 as of 2023.\\n\\nWait, sometimes numbers can be a bit off depending on the source. Maybe the exact figure is a bit different? I think the official estimate is around 3,502,800. That seems accurate. So I\\'ll use 3,500,000 for simplicity unless the user needs the precise number.\\n\\nNext, the format. The user specified JSON, so I need to structure it properly. They probably want a clear and concise JSON object with the key-value pairs.

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to figure out what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital city. That's straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the user wants information about it. That probably means some basic details like the administrative region, maybe some notable landmarks or the area. Paris is a Île-de-France region, so that's a good point to include. It's known for places like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and the City of Light. The area of the city is about 105 square kilometers, which is something specific to include.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the population. I should look up the latest estimates. I think the population is around 2.2 million people. However, I should note that this is an approximation and can vary each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, putting all this into JSON format. I need to structure it correctly with the key-value pairs. The keys should be descriptive, like \"Name,\" \"Region,\" \"Notable_Sites,\" \"Area,\" and \"Population.\" Each value should be a string that provides the necessary information clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include the population range instead of a single number? That might be better because populations can fluctuate. So maybe change \"Population\" to \"Population Estimates\" with low, mid, and high figures. That way, it's more accurate and gives a better picture of the current population status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me double-check the details. Paris is indeed the capital, Île-de-France is correct, the Eiffel Tower and Louvre are must-mention sites. The area is roughly 105 km², and the population is about 2.19 to 2.21 million. Yes, that sounds right.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key is in quotes, and the entire structure is properly formatted with braces. No trailing commas or missing brackets. That's important for JSON to parse correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look clean and organized, making it easy for the user to read and use if needed. I think that covers everything the user asked for.\n",
