    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France.

First, I need to figure out who the user is and why they\\'re asking. They might be a student working on a project, a researcher compiling data, or maybe just curious about demographics.\\n\\nThe capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s straightforward. Next, I have to gather accurate and up-to-date information. Population numbers can change, especially since it\\'s a big city with ongoing influx of people. I remember reading that Paris had around 2.2 million in 2021, but I should double-check that for 2023. It\\'s important to provide the most recent data to ensure the information is relevant.\\n\\nWhen structuring the JSON, I\\'ll need to include key-value pairs. Maybe start with \"Name\" for the capital, then \"Population\" and \")]);\\nI should also consider if the user wants more details, like the percentage of the population living there or other stats. But since they only mentioned population, I\\'ll stick to that.\\n\\nI need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct to avoid errors. Proper commas and brackets are essential. Also, formatting the number correctly with commas for readability.\\n\\nLastly, I\\'ll present the info clearly so the user can easily extract what they need without confusion.\\n\\nOkay, I think that covers the user\\'s request comprehensively. Let\\'s put it all together in the JSON format they asked for.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly! Here is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"Name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": 22102361\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that the population figure is approximate and may vary slightly depending on the source and year of the data.

First, they want the capital, which I know is Paris. Then, they want the population. Wait, I should make sure about the latest data because population figures change over time.\n",

      "I remember that as of recent estimates, Paris has a population around 2.1 million. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that to be accurate. Oh, right, I think it's approximately 2,150,000 as of 2023. So, I should include that in the JSON.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user specified JSON format. I need to structure this correctly. They probably want a clear and concise JSON object. So, the main object will be \"capital\" with keys like name, population, and maybe a flag for whether it's the most populous city in France.\n",

      "I should also consider the structure. Should it be a single object or nested? Probably a top-level object is better for simplicity. So, the JSON will have a key \"capital\" which contains the name, population, and maybe that flag.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm thinking about the keys. \"name\" for the city name, \"population\" as an integer, and \"is_most_populous\" as a boolean. That makes sense. I'll format it properly with commas and brackets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me make sure there are no typos. Paris, population 2150000, and the boolean flag. Yep, that looks right. I should present it neatly so it's easy to read.\n",
