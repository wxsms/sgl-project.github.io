    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '76c5e8608d3841e1a4bb240d89f5eeec', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.574164390563965, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763200294.6091661}}</strong>"

Now, I should recall the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. \\n\\nI think it\\'s been increasing over the years, but I\\'m not certain how much. I\\'ve heard it\\'s around 3 million maybe? Or is it a bit more? Wait, I think I\\'ve seen articles or read somewhere that the population might be just over 3 million. Let me see if that makes sense.\\n\\nI think the population figure could vary slightly depending on the source and the year it\\'s measured in. So, the number might change a little each year. But for a general estimate, I guess 3,000,000 is a common figure quoted for Paris.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON format response should include the key \"capital\" pointing to \"Paris\" and the key \"population\" pointing to 3,001,000 as of 2023. That seems reasonable because I think in recent years, Paris has slightly exceeded 3 million people.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. I recall reading that Paris has a population over 3 million, so 3,001,000 sounds accurate. No, wait, is it 3,001,000 or maybe 3,003,000? Hmm, I\\'m not too sure about the exact number beyond 3 million. I think for the purpose of this question, using 3,001,000 is a good estimate unless more precise information is available.\\n\\nAlso, considering that the capital is Paris, which is a major city, 3 million seems about right. So to sum up, the JSON object should have the keys \"capital\" and \"population\" with the appropriate values.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3001000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object states that the capital of France is Paris, with an estimated population of 3,001,000.', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 19091, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 448, 264, 3460, 7042, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 432, 594, 1012, 7703, 916, 279, 1635, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 3654, 1246, 1753, 13, 358, 3003, 6617, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 18, 3526, 7196, 30, 2521, 374, 432, 264, 2699, 803, 30, 13824, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 3884, 9709, 476, 1349, 14696, 429, 279, 7042, 2578, 387, 1101, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 421, 429, 3643, 5530, 382, 40, 1744, 279, 7042, 7071, 1410, 13289, 10078, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 432, 594, 16878, 304, 13, 2055, 11, 279, 1372, 2578, 2297, 264, 2632, 1817, 1042, 13, 1988, 369, 264, 4586, 16045, 11, 358, 7942, 220, 18, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 374, 264, 4185, 7071, 23237, 369, 12095, 382, 4416, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 3561, 2033, 1265, 2924, 279, 1376, 330, 65063, 1, 21633, 311, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 279, 1376, 330, 44441, 1, 21633, 311, 220, 18, 11, 15, 15, 16, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 2938, 4977, 13276, 1576, 358, 1744, 304, 3213, 1635, 11, 12095, 702, 10078, 33808, 220, 18, 3526, 1251, 382, 14190, 11, 1077, 752, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 358, 19091, 5290, 429, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 773, 220, 18, 11, 15, 15, 16, 11, 15, 15, 15, 10362, 13382, 13, 2308, 11, 3783, 11, 374, 432, 220, 18, 11, 15, 15, 16, 11, 15, 15, 15, 476, 7196, 220, 18, 11, 15, 15, 18, 11, 15, 15, 15, 30, 88190, 11, 358, 2776, 537, 2238, 2704, 911, 279, 4734, 1372, 7797, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 358, 1744, 369, 279, 7428, 315, 419, 3405, 11, 1667, 220, 18, 11, 15, 15, 16, 11, 15, 15, 15, 374, 264, 1661, 16045, 7241, 803, 23560, 1995, 374, 2500, 382, 13394, 11, 12831, 429, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 892, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 220, 18, 3526, 4977, 911, 1290, 13, 2055, 311, 2629, 705, 11, 279, 4718, 1633, 1265, 614, 279, 6894, 330, 65063, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 1, 448, 279, 8311, 2750, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 15, 15, 16, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 1633, 5302, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 448, 458, 12943, 7042, 315, 220, 18, 11, 15, 15, 16, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '312370200f98454194a976aa87f33fa9', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 483, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.093595027923584, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763200311.989611}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to determine the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital. That's straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I should figure out the population. I remember that Paris is a very large city, so the population is in the millions. I think it's around 2 million, but I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly 2.1 or 2.2. Maybe I should double-check that. I recall that as of the latest estimates, Paris has a population of approximately 2,158,000 as of 2023. But I'm not 100% certain if that's the current number, so I should mention that the figure might vary slightly depending on the source.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data in a readable format. I should create an object with relevant fields. The main pieces of information are the city name and the population. So, I'll set up a JSON object with \"city\" as the key and \"population\" as another key. Under \"population,\" I'll include the numerical value followed by the unit, which is people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look like this: { \"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2158000 }. I'll make sure to mention in the response that the population figure is approximate and might change over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the user's perspective. They might be looking for a structured data format, possibly for integration into another system or for easy parsing. By providing the JSON, I'm making it accessible for them to use in their applications or analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe adding more details, but the user specifically asked for the capital's population, so I should stick to that. I don't want to include additional cities or regions unless it's necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should ensure that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Since there are no commas in the keys or the values, the JSON should be simple and straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, I'll provide the JSON with the city name and population, note that the population is approximate, and ensure the syntax is correct.\n",
