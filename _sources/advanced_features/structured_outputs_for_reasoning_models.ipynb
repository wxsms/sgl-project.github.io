    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

I think the population has been increasing over the years, so perhaps it's now over 3.5 million? I'm a bit confused because sometimes I hear different numbers, so I should make sure. Maybe I can recall that Paris has a metropolitan area that's much larger, but the city proper is around 3.5 million. I think I'll go with that for now.<br><br><br>content: Paris is the capital of France</strong>"

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. I know that France is a country in Europe, and I remember that Paris is the capital. Let me confirm that. Yeah, Paris is definitely France\\'s capital.\\n\\nNow, about the population. I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number, but I think it\\'s around 20-something million. But I should be more precise. Maybe I\\'ll check with some general knowledge or known sources. I recall that major French cities have populations over 10 million, so Paris might be one of them.\\n\\nWait, I think I heard somewhere that Paris has a population of about 12 million. But I\\'m not entirely confident. I remember reading that it\\'s one of the most populous cities in Europe. However, considering the whole country, France has a larger population. Maybe around 67 million? That sounds familiar but I\\'m not 100% sure.\\n\\nI should think about whether the population includes both metropolitan areas and the rural regions. I believe the metropolitan area of Paris is about 12 million, while the overall country might be around 67 million. So, to summarize, the capital is Paris with a metropolitan population of about 12 million, and the country\\'s total population is approximately 67 million.\\n\\nI should also consider if there are any recent estimates. Maybe since I\\'m providing a general answer, I can mention both the metropolitan area and the country\\'s total population. That way, the information is more complete and accurate. So, Paris is the capital with a metropolitan population of around 12 million, and France has a population of about 67 million.\\n\\nI think that\\'s a reasonable breakdown, but I\\'m still a bit unsure about the exact numbers. Maybe I can think of other sources or remember any notable cities. For example, Lyon is the second-largest city in France, so it\\'s unlikely to be the capital. That reinforces that Paris is correct.\\n\\nSo, wrapping it up, the JSON response should include the country name, its capital city, and the population. I should structure it as:\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 67000000\\n}\\n\\nBut wait, I think I\\'ve heard that the population has been increasing, so 67 million might be a bit off. Maybe it\\'s closer to 66 million. I\\'ll go with 66,000,000 as a more accurate figure. However, I\\'m not entirely certain, but since the user just asked for the general information, this should suffice.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 67000000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON structure provides the requested information about France, including its capital city Paris and an approximate population of 67 million.', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 323, 1181, 7042, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 9625, 374, 264, 3146, 304, 4505, 11, 323, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 13, 6771, 752, 7683, 429, 13, 21607, 11, 12095, 374, 8491, 9625, 594, 6722, 382, 7039, 11, 911, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 11, 714, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 1331, 11532, 3526, 13, 1988, 358, 1265, 387, 803, 23560, 13, 10696, 358, 3278, 1779, 448, 1045, 4586, 6540, 476, 3881, 8173, 13, 358, 19091, 429, 3598, 8585, 9720, 614, 21910, 916, 220, 16, 15, 3526, 11, 773, 12095, 2578, 387, 825, 315, 1105, 382, 14190, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 6617, 14696, 429, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 16, 17, 3526, 13, 1988, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 16506, 13, 358, 6099, 5290, 429, 432, 594, 825, 315, 279, 1429, 94451, 9720, 304, 4505, 13, 4354, 11, 12831, 279, 4361, 3146, 11, 9625, 702, 264, 8131, 7042, 13, 10696, 2163, 220, 21, 22, 3526, 30, 2938, 10362, 11285, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 220, 16, 15, 15, 4, 2704, 382, 40, 1265, 1744, 911, 3425, 279, 7042, 5646, 2176, 57406, 5671, 323, 279, 19082, 13604, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 57406, 3082, 315, 12095, 374, 911, 220, 16, 17, 3526, 11, 1393, 279, 8084, 3146, 2578, 387, 2163, 220, 21, 22, 3526, 13, 2055, 11, 311, 62079, 11, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 448, 264, 57406, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 16, 17, 3526, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 594, 2790, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 21, 22, 3526, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 421, 1052, 525, 894, 3213, 17530, 13, 10696, 2474, 358, 2776, 8241, 264, 4586, 4226, 11, 358, 646, 6286, 2176, 279, 57406, 3082, 323, 279, 3146, 594, 2790, 7042, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1995, 374, 803, 4583, 323, 13382, 13, 2055, 11, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 448, 264, 57406, 7042, 315, 2163, 220, 16, 17, 3526, 11, 323, 9625, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 21, 22, 3526, 382, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 264, 13276, 29985, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 2058, 264, 2699, 42903, 911, 279, 4734, 5109, 13, 10696, 358, 646, 1744, 315, 1008, 8173, 476, 6099, 894, 27190, 9720, 13, 1752, 3110, 11, 55201, 374, 279, 2086, 66967, 3283, 304, 9625, 11, 773, 432, 594, 17367, 311, 387, 279, 6722, 13, 2938, 94493, 429, 12095, 374, 4396, 382, 4416, 11, 41195, 432, 705, 11, 279, 4718, 2033, 1265, 2924, 279, 3146, 829, 11, 1181, 6722, 3283, 11, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 1265, 5944, 432, 438, 510, 515, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 21, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 630, 3983, 3783, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 6617, 429, 279, 7042, 702, 1012, 7703, 11, 773, 220, 21, 22, 3526, 2578, 387, 264, 2699, 1007, 13, 10696, 432, 594, 12128, 311, 220, 21, 21, 3526, 13, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 220, 21, 21, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 264, 803, 13382, 7071, 13, 4354, 11, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 3654, 11, 714, 2474, 279, 1196, 1101, 4588, 369, 279, 4586, 1995, 11, 419, 1265, 76156, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 21, 22, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 5944, 5707, 279, 11223, 1995, 911, 9625, 11, 2670, 1181, 6722, 3283, 12095, 323, 458, 44868, 7042, 315, 220, 21, 22, 3526, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '51466a36ab1447cf945a6d8080cd8e4f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 606, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'cached_tokens_details': None, 'e2e_latency': 3.7514569759368896, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1770619976.3441482}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so I need to find out the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I should identify what the capital of France is. From what I remember, Paris is the capital of France. But just to be sure, I'll double-check that. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find out the population of Paris. I know that major cities in France are usually around a few million people. Paris is one of the most populous cities in Europe, so its population must be in the millions. I'm trying to recall the exact number, but I might be a bit fuzzy on the details. I think it's around 2 million or maybe a bit more. Wait, I think it's actually over 3 million. Let me try to remember specific numbers or recent statistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall that Paris had a population of approximately 2.1 million in the early 2000s. But since then, the population has been growing due to immigration and other factors. I've heard that it's around 2.2 to 2.3 million now. However, I'm not entirely certain about the exact figure. Maybe I should check some sources or recent reports for the most accurate number.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider whether the population figure is up to date. Since I'm providing this information now, perhaps as of 2023, I need to look for the latest data. I think the population has continued to grow, so maybe it's somewhere between 2.3 and 2.4 million. But I'm not entirely sure. To be precise, I should aim for the most recent and accurate figure available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I should think about how to present this information in JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to structure the data accordingly. The keys could be \"city\" and \"population,\" with the respective values being \"Paris\" and the numerical population figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to ensure that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas, quotation marks, and braces. I'll have to avoid any syntax errors to make sure the JSON is valid. Maybe I should format it properly, using indentation for readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact population number. Let me try to recall if I've heard any specific statistics. I think in recent years, the population has been around 2.2 to 2.3 million. But to confirm, perhaps I can think of other sources or articles that mention the population of Paris. I seem to remember that it's about 2.16 million as of 2023. That seems more accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the JSON object should have a key \"capital\" with the value \"Paris,\" and another key \"population\" with the value 2160000. That way, it's clear and concise, and the user can easily access the information they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted so that it can be used without issues. No typos, correct use of braces and commas. Maybe I can write it out step by step to avoid mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the steps are: identify the capital of France, find the latest population figure, structure the information into a JSON object with appropriate keys, and ensure the JSON syntax is correct.\n",
