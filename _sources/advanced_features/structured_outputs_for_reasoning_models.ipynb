    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

The user mentioned they're in New York, so I should probably start by determining the correct timezone for New York. I think New York is in the Eastern Time Zone, which is 'America/New_York'. <br><br>Next, I remember the functions available: 'get_current_weather' and 'get_current_date'. For the date and time, I'll use 'get_current_date' with the timezone parameter set to 'America/New_York'. <br><br>Now, for the weather, I need to figure out the city and state. New York is a city in the state of New York, so the city parameter would be 'New York' and the state would be 'NY'. The unit isn't specified, but since the user didn't mention it, I might assume Celsius, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I could include both units or let the function handle it. Hmm, maybe it's better to just use Celsius for now unless the user specifies otherwise.<br><br>So, I'll structure the function calls step by step. First, call 'get_current_date' with the timezone. Then, call 'get_current_weather' with the city, state, and unit. I should make sure to format the parameters correctly as JSON objects within the function calls.<br><br>Wait, the user said to only reply in a specific format, using tags and parameters. So I need to structure each function call properly. I'll start with the date function, then the weather function, each with their respective parameters.<br><br>I think I'm ready to put it all together.

I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '6ed0e47fa8af418ba740ff59c85e26f7', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.351101875305176, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1767378351.851114}}</strong>"

Hmm, first, I should figure out what they really need. They probably want a clear, structured response. JSON is commonly used for data, so that makes sense.\\n\\nLet me break it down. The capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s straightforward. The next question is about the population. I should include an approximate number. I remember it\\'s around 2 million. But I should note that it\\'s a rough estimate since populations can change a lot based on birth, death, and migration rates. Maybe add information on the city limits and urban area to give a broader picture.\\n\\nWait, should I mention where the population count comes from? It\\'s best to avoid speculation about the source, so I\\'ll keep it general. Including the note about population changes and sources is good practice to ensure the user knows the data might not be exact.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure should be simple with a \"capital\" key. Under that, the city name, population, and maybe some additional info like city limits and urban area population. I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Let me double-check that to avoid any errors.\\n\\nAlright, I think I have all the necessary information. Let me construct the JSON. Yes, that looks good. I should offer further assistance too, in case they need more details or something else. That way, the user feels supported beyond the initial query.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 20193672,\\n    \"city_limits_population\": 1974,\\n    \"urban_area_population\": 22200000\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON includes the population of Paris (as of approximate data), the population within city limits, and the population of the urban area.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to find the population of the capital of France, which is Paris. Let me start by recalling what I know about Paris. I think it's one of the most populous cities in the world, maybe even the capital. I remember hearing that Paris has a really high population density because it's a big city with a lot of people living in a small area.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should probably look up the most recent population figures for Paris. I think the population numbers can change every year, so it's important to get the latest data. Maybe I can check some reliable sources like official government websites or recent news articles. I believe the French government releases population statistics, so perhaps I can find that on their official site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but since I'm just thinking about this, I'll try to recall if I know any recent estimates. I think the population of Paris was around 2 million people a few years ago. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact year. Let me think, I remember that Paris is divided into several districts, like the Île-de-France region, which includes Paris and its suburbs. Maybe I should consider the metropolitan area instead of just the city proper.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I'm looking for the metropolitan area, the population is probably much higher. I think it's somewhere around 12 million or so. That seems like a common figure I've heard before. However, I'm not 100% certain if that's the latest number. Population growth can be tricky because it depends on birth rates, immigration, and other factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider whether the data is up to date. If I'm asking for the population in 2023, I need to make sure the information I'm using is from that year or the most recent available. Maybe I can check a recent census or a report from the French National Institute of Statistics and Documentation (Insee).\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to think about is the source of the data. Is it from a government website, a reputable news outlet, or somewhere else? It's important to use reliable sources to ensure the accuracy of the information. If I'm unsure, I might want to cross-check the numbers with multiple sources to confirm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should be clear about what exactly is being measured. Is it the population of Paris proper, or the metropolitan area? Sometimes people refer to the entire region as the \"capital,\" which includes surrounding areas. This distinction can affect the population numbers significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if there are any ongoing projects or initiatives that might be affecting the population numbers. For example, migration into or out of Paris due to economic changes, changes in birth rates, or even natural disasters. These factors can all influence the population over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, I need to find the most recent and accurate population figure for Paris, whether it's the city proper or the metropolitan area, and make sure I'm using a reliable source. If I can't recall the exact number, I should look it up to provide the correct information. Once I have the number, I can format it in JSON as requested.\n",
