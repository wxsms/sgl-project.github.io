    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'ab82c490fd65415f8dec6b5a7dc4689b', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.7868478298187256, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766517646.4869356}}</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital is. I know that Paris is the capital of France. \\n\\nNext, they want the population. As of 2023, I remember reading that Paris has a population of around 2.17 million. I should make sure to confirm the most recent data but I think that\\'s accurate enough for the response.\\n\\nThey specifically asked for the population, so I\\'ll include that in the JSON structure. The key should be \"capital\" and the value should be the city name. Another key can be \"population\" with the numerical value.\\n\\nJSON format requires nested objects or arrays, so I\\'ll structure it with an \" capita \" key containing all the necessary information. This way, the user can easily extract both pieces of data if needed.\\n\\nI don\\'t think they need any additional details, just the information they asked for.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I just got a query from a user asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I need to figure out the best way to respond. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should identify the capital of France. From what I know, Paris is the capital of France. That seems pretty straightforward. Now, the user wants the population data. I remember that population numbers can change over time, so I need to make sure I have the most recent data available.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the latest population figure I recall is around 21 million people. But wait, is that the exact number, or is it an estimate? I should double-check to be accurate. Let me think... I believe the official estimate is approximately 21,649,000 as of 2023. That's a reliable figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user specified they want this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. So, I need to structure the data in a JSON object.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should include the key \"city\" with the value \"Paris\" and another key \"population\" with the number. It's good practice to format the JSON neatly, using proper indentation for readability. So, the structure would be something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"city\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 21649000\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider any potential issues. For example, is there a chance that the population figure could change before I provide this? Well, I can't predict future changes, but I can note that the figure is current as of 2023. That way, the user is aware and knows to check for updates if they need the most current data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thought: should I include a source for the population data? Maybe in an actual response, but since this is a simple query, perhaps it's unnecessary unless the user requests it. So, I'll keep it concise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON as shown, ensuring that the keys are in uppercase letters and the values are properly formatted. I'll make sure there are commas in the correct places to avoid any syntax errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's it. The user likely needs this information for a quick reference or perhaps for a project they're working on. By providing the JSON format, they can easily integrate this data into their application or document without hassle. Also, by including the population number, they probably want a clear and direct answer without having to search for additional data sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to sum up, the response will be a JSON object with two keys: \"city\" pointing to \"Paris\" and \"population\" pointing to 21649000. This should fulfill the user's request effectively.\n",
