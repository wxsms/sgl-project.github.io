    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is in New York and wants to know the current date and time along with the weather. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I need to figure out how to get the current date and time. The available function for that is 'get_current_date'. It requires a 'timezone' parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should use 'America/New_York' as the timezone. That should give me the correct date and time when I call the function.<br><br>Next, the weather information. The function 'get_current_weather' is perfect for this. It needs a 'city' and 'state' parameter. The user is in New York, so the city is 'New York' and the state is 'NY'. Also, they might prefer the temperature in Fahrenheit since that's commonly used in the US, so I'll set 'unit' to 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>Now, I should call these functions in sequence. First, get the current date and time for New York's timezone. Then, use that same timezone information when fetching the weather, but wait, no—the weather function doesn't need the timezone because it's just the city and state. So I can call 'get_current_weather' separately with the required parameters.<br><br>I need to make sure each function call is properly formatted. For 'get_current_date', the parameters should be a JSON object with 'timezone' as 'America/New_York'. For 'get_current_weather', it's 'city' as 'New York', 'state' as 'NY', and 'unit' as 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll send two separate function calls. The first will handle the date and time, and the second will handle the weather. Each will be on its own line with the correct parameters.<br><br>I should also remember to include the sources in the response, but since the user is using predefined functions, I don't need to look up any real-time data—just follow the function calls as instructed.<br><br>So, the final answer will have two function calls: one for the date and time, and another for the weather, each properly formatted with their respective parameters.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

Hmm, let\\'s start by recalling what I know about the capital of France. I believe it\\'s Paris, but I\\'m not 100% sure. Maybe I should double-check that first. Yes, Paris is indeed the capital city of France. \\n\\nNow, the user wants the population information. I\\'m not certain of the exact population number. I think it\\'s somewhere around 2 million people, but I might be off. I should consider whether it\\'s the metropolitan area or the city proper. I remember hearing that the metropolitan area population is higher than the city itself. \\n\\nWait, I think the population of Paris is approximately 2,100,000. But maybe that\\'s not accurate. I should check if there\\'s a source I can reference. I recall that the city has grown a lot over the years, especially with tourism anddif我国是一个拥有悠久历史和丰富文化的国家，人工智能技术的快速发展为社会的各个领域带来了巨大变革。在这一背景下，如何在保持传统文化的同时，推动科技创新，实现可持续发展，是当前面临的重要课题。\\n\\n为了更好地理解中国的发展现状和未来方向，我决定深入学习中国的发展历程。我了解到中国自改革开放以来，经济取得了惊人的增长，人民生活水平显著提高，社会主义现代化建设取得了巨大成就。同时，中国在科技创新领域也取得了一系列突破，比如在人工智能、量子计算等领域的研究和应用。\\n\\n不过，我也意识到中国在传统文明和现代科技之间存在一定的矛盾。例如，在追求经济增长的同时，如何保护和传承传统文化是一个重要的挑战。此外，科技创新虽然为社会带来了积极的变化，但也带来了一些环境和社会问题，如资源消耗和环境污染。\\n\\n为了找到解决这些问题的方法，我需要更多的信息和数据支持。我计划查阅一些关于中国近年来在科技和文化领域取得的成就的案例，以及相关的政策和法规。通过这些资料，我可以更好地理解中国的发展模式和未来趋势。\\n\\n首先，我查阅了关于中国人口政策的资料，发现中国实行的是独生子女政策，这一政策在过去的几十年里对国家的人口结构产生了深远的影响。近年来，为了应对人口老龄化和劳动力短缺的问题，中国政府已经开始实施了全面两孩政策，并计划在未来推行三孩政策，以便更好地平衡人口与发展。\\n\\n在科技创新方面，中国的投入和成就举世瞩目。中国已经拥有了许多世界领先的科技企业，如华为、腾讯和阿里巴巴。这些企业不仅在全球市场上具有竞争力，还在科技创新领域取得了诸多奖项和殊荣。然而，中国在某些高科技领域仍然面临挑战，尤其是在基础理论研究和原创技术方面。\\n\\n为了保持传统文化，中国实施了文化保护和传承的政策，如传统节日的振兴和非物质文化遗产的保护。然而，随着经济的快速发展，传统文化的传承面临着前所未有的压力，许多人选择外出工作，导致传统节日的人流逐渐减少。因此，如何在现代与传统之间找到平衡点，是需要认真思考的问题。\\n\\n此外，中国在环境保护方面也做出了努力。政府推进了绿色发展，提倡使用清洁能源，努力减少碳排放。然而，快速的经济增长和随即而来的能源需求，使得中国在环境问题上仍然面临很大的挑战。如何在经济快速发展和环境保护之间找到平衡，是另一个需要解决的问题。\\n\\n综合以上思考，我认为解决这些挑战需要多方面的努力和相应的政策支持。国家层面需要制定科学合理的政策，引导社会在传统文化和科技创新之间找到平衡，同时在环境保护方面形成可持续的发展模式。个人层面，也需要每个人都积极参与到国家的发展中去，支持科技创新和环境保护的努力。\\n\\n总的来说，中国的可持续发展道路是一个复杂而艰巨的任务，但通过不断的探索和调整，相信中国一定能够找到一条既能促进经济增长，又能保护环境、传承传统文化的发展道路。\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user just asked me to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. They mentioned both information and population, so I should cover the basics about the capital, which is Paris, and include some key data points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, I should start by identifying the main components. The capital's name is Paris, and its location is in Île-de-France, France. Population-wise, as of the latest data, it's around 2.1 million people. But wait, I remember the population has been growing recently, so maybe I should include the approximate figure and note that it's an estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the data sources. Population figures can change over time, so it's best to mention that the number is approximate. Maybe I should specify the year, but since the user didn't mention a particular year, I'll go with the most recent available, which is 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to structure this information in JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"Name\", \"Location\", \"Population\", and \"Description\". The description can include some interesting facts about Paris, like being a cultural, economic, and political center, as well as its landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and brackets. Also, since JSON is sensitive to syntax, I'll double-check for any missing quotes or brackets. Maybe I can add a comment or note that the population figure is an estimate to avoid any confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user might be using this data for a project or presentation, so accuracy is key. I should ensure the population figure is as up-to-date as possible. I recall that in 2021, Paris had around 2.17 million people, and it's been growing, so 2.1 million is a good average to include.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the necessary fields and include a brief description. This way, the user gets a comprehensive yet concise piece of information. I should also keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any technical jargon unless it's necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's about it. I'll format it properly, making sure each key is in quotes and the values are correctly assigned. I'll also add a comment about the population being an estimate to cover any potential inaccuracies. Alright, time to put it all into the JSON structure and double-check everything before sending the response.\n",
