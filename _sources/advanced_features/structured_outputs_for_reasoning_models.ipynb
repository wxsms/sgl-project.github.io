    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

Maybe I can recall that Paris has a metropolitan area that's much larger, but the city proper is around 3.5 million. I think I'll go with that for now.<br><br><br>content: Paris is the capital of France</strong>"

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user\\'s request. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, the capital of France is Paris, right? I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s correct. Let me think... yes, Paris is the administrative capital, though there\\'s also a cultural center called Paris Assertion Point. But for population, I should focus on the administrative center.\\n\\nI remember reading that the population of Paris is pretty large, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the latest figures. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I\\'m not certain. Maybe I should check a reliable source to confirm the exact number. Oh wait, I can just proceed with my existing knowledge since I can\\'t access the internet. I\\'ll go with the commonly cited figure of approximately 2,174,000 as of recent estimates.\\n\\nSo, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. It uses key-value pairs. I need to make sure all the information is accurate. Let me compile the data: name should be \"Paris, Île-de-France\", the population is about 2,174,000, and it\\'s the administrative capital of France.\\n\\nI also need to present this in a clear and concise manner. So, the JSON structure should have an \"info\" object containing the \"name\", \"population\", and \"capital\" fields. I\\'ll make sure there are commas in the right places to avoid syntax errors.\\n\\nWait, I should double-check if the population figure is up to date. I know that populations can change every year, and estimates can vary slightly. But since I don\\'t have the most current data, I\\'ll stick with the number I have. It\\'s better to provide an accurate figure based on the latest knowledge I have.\\n\\nIs there anything else the user might want? They only asked for the JSON, so I think I\\'ve covered everything. I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted without any errors, like missing quotes or commas misplaced. That way, when the user reads the JSON, it should parse correctly.\\n\\nOverall, the response should be straightforward. I\\'ll structure the JSON with the necessary fields and the accurate population number. I don\\'t think the user wants any additional information beyond what was asked, so I\\'ll keep it simple and to the point.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"info\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris, Île-de-France\",\\n    \"population\": 2174000,\\n    \"capital\": \"Paris\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 279, 1196, 594, 1681, 13, 2379, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 358, 2776, 5020, 2704, 429, 594, 4396, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 1112, 9834, 11, 12095, 374, 279, 22707, 6722, 11, 3498, 1052, 594, 1083, 264, 12752, 4126, 2598, 12095, 46730, 5126, 13, 1988, 369, 7042, 11, 358, 1265, 5244, 389, 279, 22707, 4126, 382, 40, 6099, 5290, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 374, 5020, 3460, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 5535, 12396, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 3654, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 311, 7683, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 8670, 3783, 11, 358, 646, 1101, 10354, 448, 847, 6350, 6540, 2474, 358, 646, 944, 2615, 279, 7602, 13, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 279, 16626, 21870, 7071, 315, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 3213, 17530, 382, 4416, 11, 279, 1196, 6801, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 13352, 369, 12914, 3002, 2806, 367, 11, 892, 374, 264, 1616, 311, 5944, 821, 13, 1084, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 13, 358, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 678, 279, 1995, 374, 13382, 13, 6771, 752, 19192, 279, 821, 25, 829, 1265, 387, 330, 59604, 11, 59108, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 497, 279, 7042, 374, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 432, 594, 279, 22707, 6722, 315, 9625, 382, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 2797, 323, 63594, 11566, 13, 2055, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1265, 614, 458, 330, 2733, 1, 1633, 8482, 279, 330, 606, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 330, 65063, 1, 5043, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 311, 5648, 19482, 5975, 382, 14190, 11, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 421, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 705, 311, 2400, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 21910, 646, 2297, 1449, 1042, 11, 323, 17530, 646, 13289, 10078, 13, 1988, 2474, 358, 1513, 944, 614, 279, 1429, 1482, 821, 11, 358, 3278, 9214, 448, 279, 1372, 358, 614, 13, 1084, 594, 2664, 311, 3410, 458, 13382, 7071, 3118, 389, 279, 5535, 6540, 358, 614, 382, 3872, 1052, 4113, 770, 279, 1196, 2578, 1366, 30, 2379, 1172, 4588, 369, 279, 4718, 11, 773, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 9761, 4297, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 374, 10277, 23126, 2041, 894, 5975, 11, 1075, 7402, 17194, 476, 76602, 89560, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 979, 279, 1196, 15804, 279, 4718, 11, 432, 1265, 4715, 12440, 382, 27489, 11, 279, 2033, 1265, 387, 30339, 13, 358, 3278, 5944, 279, 4718, 448, 279, 5871, 5043, 323, 279, 13382, 7042, 1372, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1744, 279, 1196, 6801, 894, 5107, 1995, 7797, 1128, 572, 4588, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 2506, 432, 4285, 323, 311, 279, 1459, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 2733, 788, 341, 262, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 11, 59108, 273, 6810, 7276, 34106, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 698, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '7fa4d136f9904b7bbb1841b58f1d9277', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 547, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.376992225646973, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1769647395.248899}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to find the information and population of the capital of France. First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a given. Now, I need to figure out the population. I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I remember it's a big city with millions of people. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the population is around 2 million. Wait, no, that's probably the number of residents in the Greater Paris area, including suburbs. The official population figure I've heard before was about 2.1 million. But I should double-check that. Maybe it's a bit higher now, considering growth and new developments. \n",
      "\n",
      "I recall that Paris is one of the most populous cities in the world, but the capital is different from the metropolitan area. The metropolitan area includes neighboring towns andsuburbs, which might push the population higher. So, if the metropolitan area is around 12 million, that's a big number. But the question specifically asks for the capital, not the entire metropolitan area.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider that population figures can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. Demographics can be tricky because of these factors. Maybe the current population is a bit different from the figure I remember. I think it's roughly 2.1 to 2.2 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should present the information in a clear JSON format, as the user requested. I'll structure it with \"Capital\" as the key and include both the city name and the population figure. I'll make sure the population is accurate and cite the most recent data I have. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should verify the population from a reliable source to ensure accuracy. Checking a recent census or official government publication would give the most precise number. Since I don't have access to that right now, I'll go with the commonly cited figure of approximately 2.1 million. \n",
