    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

I think the population has been increasing over the years, so perhaps it's now over 3.5 million? I'm a bit confused because sometimes I hear different numbers, so I should make sure. Maybe I can recall that Paris has a metropolitan area that's much larger, but the city proper is around 3.5 million. I think I'll go with that for now.<br><br><br>content: Paris is the capital of France</strong>"

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

First, I should recall what the capital of France is. From what I remember, the capital is Paris. \\n\\nOkay, next step is to find out the population of Paris. I think it\\'s a large city, so the population must be in the millions. I\\'ve heard it\\'s around 2 million people, but I\\'m not 100% sure. Maybe I should double-check that. Oh right, Paris is the largest city in France and one of the most populous in Europe, so 2 million sounds about right.\\n\\nNow, the user specifically asked for the information in JSON format. JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a data interchange format that\\'s easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It\\'s structured as key-value pairs. \\n\\nSo I should create an object with keys that clearly state the information they need. The keys could be \"City\", \"Population\", and \"Country\" since those are the relevant pieces of information. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure would look like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": 2000000,\\n  \"Country\": \"France\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, I should make sure the population is accurate. Maybe I should consider the latest data, as populations can change. I think the official estimate might be a bit higher, but I\\'m not certain. I\\'ll stick with 2,000,000 for now unless I have reason to believe it\\'s inaccurate. \\n\\nAlso, the country name is obviously France since Paris is its capital. \\n\\nI should present this in a clear and helpful manner, so the user gets exactly what they asked for without any extra information unless they ask for more.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": 2000000,\\n  \"Country\": \"France\"\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 1492, 279, 1196, 553, 7086, 1105, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 9625, 594, 6722, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1265, 19091, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 5542, 1128, 358, 6099, 11, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 13, 4710, 32313, 11, 1790, 3019, 374, 311, 1477, 700, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 264, 3460, 3283, 11, 773, 279, 7042, 1969, 387, 304, 279, 11728, 13, 358, 3003, 6617, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 1251, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 220, 16, 15, 15, 4, 2704, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 8670, 1290, 11, 12095, 374, 279, 7772, 3283, 304, 9625, 323, 825, 315, 279, 1429, 94451, 304, 4505, 11, 773, 220, 17, 3526, 10362, 911, 1290, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 1196, 11689, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11, 476, 12914, 3002, 2806, 367, 11, 374, 264, 821, 51263, 3561, 429, 594, 4135, 369, 12677, 311, 1349, 323, 3270, 323, 4135, 369, 12645, 311, 4715, 323, 6923, 13, 1084, 594, 32930, 438, 1376, 19083, 13530, 13, 4710, 4416, 358, 1265, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 429, 9355, 1584, 279, 1995, 807, 1184, 13, 576, 6894, 1410, 387, 330, 12730, 497, 330, 53371, 497, 323, 330, 16408, 1, 2474, 1846, 525, 279, 9760, 9666, 315, 1995, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1035, 1401, 1075, 419, 1447, 515, 220, 330, 12730, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 53371, 788, 220, 17, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 16408, 788, 330, 49000, 698, 630, 14190, 11, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 7042, 374, 13382, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 2908, 279, 5535, 821, 11, 438, 21910, 646, 2297, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 3946, 16045, 2578, 387, 264, 2699, 5080, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 3654, 13, 358, 3278, 9214, 448, 220, 17, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 369, 1431, 7241, 358, 614, 2874, 311, 4411, 432, 594, 49404, 13, 4710, 13394, 11, 279, 3146, 829, 374, 13900, 9625, 2474, 12095, 374, 1181, 6722, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 2797, 323, 10950, 11566, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 5221, 6896, 1128, 807, 4588, 369, 2041, 894, 4960, 1995, 7241, 807, 2548, 369, 803, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 12730, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 53371, 788, 220, 17, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 16408, 788, 330, 49000, 698, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'bd4a34930ee84a52b03f85e7630c0290', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 417, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'cached_tokens_details': None, 'e2e_latency': 2.5997672080993652, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1770787944.5238817}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They asked, \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand what exactly they're asking for. They want the capital of France, which I know is Paris. Then, they want information about it and its population. They specifically mentioned JSON format, so I should structure the answer accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider what information is relevant. The capital's location is important, so I'll include the country and maybe some notable landmarks. The population is straightforward, but I should provide both the current estimate and historical context, like the population growth. Also, Paris is famous for its museums, universities, and landmarks, so including those details would make the JSON more informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include the exact population number or just an approximate figure? I think providing a range with the latest data would be better. I remember that in 2021, Paris had around 2.2 million residents, but it's growing. I should check the latest sources to ensure accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, formatting. JSON requires key-value pairs. So, I'll structure it with keys like \"country,\" \"capital,\" \"population,\" and \"information.\" Under \"information,\" I can have sub-keys like \"location,\" \"famous places,\" etc. This way, the data is organized and easy to parse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the user's possible scenario. Maybe they're a student working on a project, or perhaps they're doing research. Either way, providing clear and accurate information is key. Including the population with a note on growth shows that I'm attentive to detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the user expects just the population number or more detailed stats. Including the exact number along with some context might be helpful. Also, mentioning that the population is growing can give them an idea about future projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted. Indentation and commas are important for readability, but sometimes programming environments prefer no indentation. However, since the user didn't specify, I'll go with a readable format that's easy to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the country, capital, population, and a comprehensive \"information\" section covering location, landmarks, population trends, education, and economy. This should cover what the user is asking for and provide a thorough answer.\n",
