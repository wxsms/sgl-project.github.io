    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'cd7f4f1d7b4d4622b3966ff2afb7b437', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.079313516616821, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766295730.3360634}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I just received a query asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I know that the capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s a given. Now, the next part is figuring out the population. I remember that Paris is one of the most populous cities in the world, but I\\'m not exactly sure about the latest numbers.\\n\\nI should be careful because population figures can change every year. I think the most recent data I\\'ve come across was from around 2021. If I recall correctly, it was something like over 3.5 million people. But I\\'m not 100% certain about the exact figure. Maybe I should check a reliable source like the officialParis.js or a government publication to confirm.\\n\\nWait, the user is asking for the current state, so I should use the latest estimates until a new update comes in. I should present the information clearly, including both the city name and the population. Also, since it\\'s JSON, I need to structure it properly, maybe with keys like \"city\" and \"population\".\\n\\nI should also add a note to mention that the population figure is an approximation for the most recent data. This way, the user knows it\\'s up to date and not outdated. I don\\'t need to include sources or anything extra, just the JSON and a brief comment.\\n\\nHmm, I should make sure the numbers are accurate. Let me think again. As of 2023, I believe the population is around 3,509,087. That sounds familiar. So, the JSON structure would be a bit like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3509087\\n}\\n\\nBut since the user didn\\'t specify a date, maybe I should just present it as the current estimate. I don\\'t see any need for sources in the response, just the data.\\n\\nAlright, time to compile this into the correct JSON format and add the note about it being an approximate figure.\\n</think>\\n\\n{\"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3509087}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 1101, 3949, 264, 3239, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 773, 429, 594, 264, 2661, 13, 4695, 11, 279, 1790, 949, 374, 47209, 700, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 825, 315, 279, 1429, 94451, 9720, 304, 279, 1879, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 911, 279, 5535, 5109, 382, 40, 1265, 387, 16585, 1576, 7042, 12396, 646, 2297, 1449, 1042, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 358, 3003, 2525, 3941, 572, 504, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 13, 1416, 358, 19091, 12440, 11, 432, 572, 2494, 1075, 916, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 1251, 13, 1988, 358, 2776, 537, 220, 16, 15, 15, 4, 3654, 911, 279, 4734, 7071, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 1075, 279, 3946, 59604, 2857, 476, 264, 3033, 16599, 311, 7683, 382, 14190, 11, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1482, 1584, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 990, 279, 5535, 17530, 3080, 264, 501, 2647, 4041, 304, 13, 358, 1265, 3042, 279, 1995, 9355, 11, 2670, 2176, 279, 3283, 829, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 7281, 11, 2474, 432, 594, 4718, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 432, 10277, 11, 7196, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 11436, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 5185, 311, 6286, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 458, 56204, 369, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 13, 1096, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 8788, 432, 594, 705, 311, 2400, 323, 537, 40526, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1184, 311, 2924, 8173, 476, 4113, 4960, 11, 1101, 279, 4718, 323, 264, 9814, 3980, 382, 80022, 11, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 5109, 525, 13382, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 1549, 13, 1634, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 24, 11, 15, 23, 22, 13, 2938, 10362, 11285, 13, 2055, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1035, 387, 264, 2699, 1075, 1447, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 24, 15, 23, 22, 198, 630, 3983, 2474, 279, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 2400, 11, 7196, 358, 1265, 1101, 3042, 432, 438, 279, 1482, 16045, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1490, 894, 1184, 369, 8173, 304, 279, 2033, 11, 1101, 279, 821, 382, 71486, 11, 882, 311, 19192, 419, 1119, 279, 4396, 4718, 3561, 323, 912, 279, 5185, 911, 432, 1660, 458, 44868, 7071, 624, 151649, 271, 4913, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 24, 15, 23, 22, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'cfb0a602d3164098af1645715898193d', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 437, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.8467185497283936, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766295746.5093546}}</strong>"

      "For the JSON structure, I'll need to create an object with a \"capital\" key containing all the details. Under that, I'll have \"general_info\" and \"population\". Each of these will be another object with relevant subkeys like \"city_name\", \"population\", \"area\", etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure the JSON is properly formatted so it's valid. That means using correct syntax, commas in the right places, and proper quotation marks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I'll include a comment about the population figure being approximate and subject to change. That way, the user knows that the data might not be exact and should check official sources for the latest info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON to be clear and concise, making it easy for the user to understand. I'll double-check the population numbers to ensure accuracy, maybe cross-referencing with recent sources if I can.\n",
