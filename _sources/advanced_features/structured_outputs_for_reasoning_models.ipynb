    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'de512318511f4ee0b3355326708f9521', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.718240737915039, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764570663.4190164}}</strong>"

The capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s straightforward. They want it in JSON, which is a specific data format, so I need to make sure I structure it correctly.\\n\\nFirst, I should gather accurate data. The population of Paris is well-known, but I remember it\\'s around 2 million. However, the exact figure can change, so I should look up the most recent data to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON object. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create a \"capital\" object with keys like \"city\", \"country\", \"coordinates\", and \"population\". Each key will map to its respective value.\\n\\nI also need to make sure the population is a large number since that\\'s a significant piece of information. It\\'s common to represent it in the millions, so I\\'ll use 2019 as the year to add context, even though the population might have changed slightly.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON properly, ensuring that the syntax is correct, like using double quotes around keys and string values, commas separating the keys, and making sure the formatting is clean and readable.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll offer an alternative way to get more accurate information in the future, just in case the population number is outdated.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly! Here is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"country\": \"France\",\\n    \"coordinates\": {\\n      \"latitude\": \"48.8566\",\\n      \"longitude\": \"-2.3522\"\\n    },\\n    \"population\": \"2,144,000 (as of recent estimates)\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON object contains the following details about the capital of France:\\n- Capital city: Paris\\n- Country: France\\n- Coordinates (latitude and longitude)\\n- Population estimate (as of recent data)', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 2379, 1366, 432, 304, 4718, 11, 892, 374, 264, 3151, 821, 3561, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 358, 5944, 432, 12440, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1265, 9567, 13382, 821, 13, 576, 7042, 315, 12095, 374, 1632, 21309, 11, 714, 358, 6099, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 13, 4354, 11, 279, 4734, 7071, 646, 2297, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1401, 705, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 311, 5978, 13403, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 264, 330, 65063, 1, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 11141, 497, 330, 34739, 497, 323, 330, 44441, 3263, 8886, 1376, 686, 2415, 311, 1181, 19511, 897, 382, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 279, 7042, 374, 264, 3460, 1372, 2474, 429, 594, 264, 5089, 6573, 315, 1995, 13, 1084, 594, 4185, 311, 4009, 432, 304, 279, 11728, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 220, 17, 15, 16, 24, 438, 279, 1042, 311, 912, 2266, 11, 1496, 3498, 279, 7042, 2578, 614, 5497, 10078, 382, 7039, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 10277, 11, 22573, 429, 279, 19482, 374, 4396, 11, 1075, 1667, 1990, 17194, 2163, 6894, 323, 914, 2750, 11, 76602, 49445, 279, 6894, 11, 323, 3259, 2704, 279, 36566, 374, 4240, 323, 33798, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3010, 458, 10555, 1616, 311, 633, 803, 13382, 1995, 304, 279, 3853, 11, 1101, 304, 1142, 279, 7042, 1372, 374, 40526, 624, 151649, 271, 95456, 0, 5692, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 262, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 262, 330, 34739, 788, 341, 414, 330, 23718, 788, 330, 19, 23, 13, 23, 20, 21, 21, 756, 414, 330, 25446, 788, 6523, 17, 13, 18, 20, 17, 17, 698, 262, 1153, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 330, 17, 11, 16, 19, 19, 11, 15, 15, 15, 320, 300, 315, 3213, 17530, 12954, 220, 456, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 1633, 5610, 279, 2701, 3565, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 510, 12, 18374, 3283, 25, 12095, 198, 12, 14106, 25, 9625, 198, 12, 62501, 320, 23718, 323, 20515, 340, 12, 39529, 16045, 320, 300, 315, 3213, 821, 8, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '5bc675285e1c494b94d9467a0ae75859', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 428, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.7174453735351562, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764570681.2632527}}</strong>"
