    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'c624b2d0aa594258972e5e77dda747a4', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'cached_tokens_details': None, 'e2e_latency': 2.3563077449798584, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1771384673.9202263}}</strong>"

Alright, first, where is the capital of France? I remember it\\'s Paris, right? That\\'s the big one. \\n\\nNow, I need the capital\\'s information and population. The user provided an example response: `{\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 21544352}`. So, I should follow that structure. \\n\\nBut wait, is that the current population, or is it outdated? I know populations can change, so maybe I should check a reliable source. Let me think... I believe as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2.15 million. That makes sense because the city is huge. \\n\\nHmm, does the user want only the city name or the administrative capital? The example uses `Paris` directly, so I think it\\'s the city name. Also, should I include additional information like administrative division? The example doesn\\'t, so maybe just stick to what\\'s requested.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with commas and quotes. Oh, also, the population should be a number without the commas in the number. So, `21544352` instead of `21,544,352`. \\n\\nWait, is that correct? I think in JSON, numbers don\\'t have commas, so that\\'s right. \\n\\nAlright, so putting it all together: the key is \"capital\" with the value \"Paris,\" and the key \"population\" with the value 21544352. That should cover it.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe JSON format for the information and population of the capital of France is as follows:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 21544352\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 97593, 11, 1156, 11, 1380, 374, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 30, 358, 6099, 432, 594, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 2938, 594, 279, 2409, 825, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 279, 6722, 594, 1995, 323, 7042, 13, 576, 1196, 3897, 458, 3110, 2033, 25, 1565, 4913, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 19, 19, 18, 20, 17, 5541, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 1265, 1795, 429, 5944, 13, 4710, 3983, 3783, 11, 374, 429, 279, 1482, 7042, 11, 476, 374, 432, 40526, 30, 358, 1414, 21910, 646, 2297, 11, 773, 7196, 358, 1265, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 1112, 358, 4411, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 20, 3526, 13, 2938, 3643, 5530, 1576, 279, 3283, 374, 6765, 13, 4710, 80022, 11, 1558, 279, 1196, 1366, 1172, 279, 3283, 829, 476, 279, 22707, 6722, 30, 576, 3110, 5711, 1565, 59604, 63, 5961, 11, 773, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 279, 3283, 829, 13, 7281, 11, 1265, 358, 2924, 5107, 1995, 1075, 22707, 12804, 30, 576, 3110, 3171, 944, 11, 773, 7196, 1101, 9214, 311, 1128, 594, 11223, 382, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 374, 10277, 23126, 448, 76602, 323, 17194, 13, 8670, 11, 1083, 11, 279, 7042, 1265, 387, 264, 1372, 2041, 279, 76602, 304, 279, 1372, 13, 2055, 11, 1565, 17, 16, 20, 19, 19, 18, 20, 17, 63, 4518, 315, 1565, 17, 16, 11, 20, 19, 19, 11, 18, 20, 17, 28587, 4710, 14190, 11, 374, 429, 4396, 30, 358, 1744, 304, 4718, 11, 5109, 1513, 944, 614, 76602, 11, 773, 429, 594, 1290, 13, 4710, 71486, 11, 773, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 25, 279, 1376, 374, 330, 65063, 1, 448, 279, 897, 330, 59604, 1335, 323, 279, 1376, 330, 44441, 1, 448, 279, 897, 220, 17, 16, 20, 19, 19, 18, 20, 17, 13, 2938, 1265, 3421, 432, 624, 151649, 271, 785, 4718, 3561, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 438, 11017, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 19, 19, 18, 20, 17, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'd7d28dc6443e415897953ab213c7ddc2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 390, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'cached_tokens_details': None, 'e2e_latency': 3.6855480670928955, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1771384690.9983451}}</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I remember it's Paris, but I should double-check to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, they want the population. I'm not exactly sure about the current number, but I think it's around 2 million. However, populations can change, so maybe I should note that it's an approximate figure. I should also mention that this number can vary depending on the source and the year it's recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user specified the format as JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, so I need to structure the information into key-value pairs. The main keys would be \"City\" for the capital and \"Population\" for the number. Including a \"Source\" makes sense to indicate where the population data comes from, maybe the latest census or a reliable demographic report.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with correct syntax—commas in the right places, colons after keys, and proper braces. Also, the population number should be a number type in JSON, not a string, so I'll write it as 2000000 without quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look clean and easy to read. I'll present it in a code block so it's formatted nicely. Double-checking everything, I think this covers what the user asked for: the capital, its population, and the data is presented in the desired JSON format.\n",
