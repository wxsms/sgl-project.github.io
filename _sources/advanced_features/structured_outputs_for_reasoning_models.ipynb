    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '58e26b1f87ef44de96a6a8c966d1f9d2', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.55265474319458, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1767089861.362368}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify what exactly they\\'re asking for. The capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s clear. They want both general information about the city and its population. But they also specified JSON format, which means they likely want a structured, data-friendly response, maybe for a program or website.\\n\\nNext, I should remember to include both population statistics and any notable features of Paris. The population figure can vary each year, but the most recent I know is around 2.16 million as of 2021. I should check if the data is up to date, but since I can\\'t browse the internet, I\\'ll go with the current figure I have.\\n\\nFor the information part, Paris is the capital, so city facts should include its location, nickname, biggest park\\'s name, and any significant landmarks. I\\'ll list these out to make it comprehensive yet concise.\\n\\nI also need to structure this information into a JSON format. I\\'ll create an object with an \"info\" key containing the facts and a \"population\" key with the current population. Using proper JSON syntax is important to ensure it\\'s valid and can be used wherever the user plans to apply it.\\n\\nI should make sure the response is clear and helpful, providing all necessary data without any markdown since they asked for a natural thinking process. Keeping the explanation simple, I\\'ll just state the facts and how they\\'re presented in JSON.\\n\\nDouble-checking, I think the population might have been higher in recent years, but 2.16 million seems accurate for 2023.

      "Generated text: Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Okay, let's break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward. Now, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city in France, so its population should be quite large. I think it's over 3 million people, but I'm not entirely sure of the exact number.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be accurate, I should look up the latest population data. From what I recall, as of recent estimates, Paris has a population of around 3,500,000. But I should verify this to make sure. Maybe I can check a reliable source or a recent publication. Let me think... I think the population figure has been increasing steadily over the years. So, I should present the information as of 2023, perhaps noting that the number is an estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user also specified that they want the information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So, I need to structure this information into a JSON object.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should include the key \"City\" with the value \"Paris\" and the key \"Population\" with the value as the number I found. Since the population is an estimate, I should mention that in the notes. Alternatively, I could just provide the number without additional text, but it might be better to include a note about it being an estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this:\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"City\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"Population\": 3500000,\n",
      "  \"Note\": \"Population estimate as of 2023\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Let me double-check that. Yes, commas are correctly placed, and the keys and values are properly quoted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include the units for the population? Probably not necessary since it's just a number. Also, considering recent data, I think the population has been around 3.5 million, so that should be accurate enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think I need to add anything else. The user just asked for the information and population, so providing the JSON with the city, population number, and a note about the estimate should cover it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize, the JSON response will have the city name, the population number, and a note indicating it's an estimate. That should fulfill the user's request effectively.\n",
