    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

Let me break this down.<br><br>First, the user mentioned they're in New York, so I should use that as the timezone.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it's over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, first, I need to make sure I understand correctly. The capital of France is Paris, so that\\'s clear. \\n\\nOkay, I should gather the population figure. I know that population numbers can change, so I should look up the most recent, maybe around 2023. Wait, the exact number I remember is approximately 3.5 million, but I should verify that. Also, Paris has a large area, so perhaps I should note the city\\'s population separately from the metro area or the entire urbanized area?\\n\\nI should check if the user wants a specific source or if a general figure is acceptable. Since they just asked, I\\'ll provide the commonly accepted number and mention the metro area for context. That way, it\\'s informative but not misleading.\\n\\nNext, formatting this into JSON. I\\'ll need to structure it with a proper format, making sure keys are correct. Maybe include \"city_name\", \"population\", and \"city_area_population\". That\\'s clear and organized.\\n\\nDo I need to include other cities in France related to Paris? Like Île-de-France or the region it\\'s part of? I don\\'t think so, because the user specifically asked for the capital. So maybe those other areas are optional and can be omitted unless the user asks for more details.\\n\\nAlso, should I include sources or notes about the data? Probably not necessary here, unless the user has a reason to verify the figures. Since it\\'s a straightforward request, sticking to the numbers and the city\\'s name is best.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should consider if the user is using this data for a project or just curiosity. They might need accurate and up-to-date information, so providing the most recent stats would be best. Also, checking if there\\'s a standard way populations are rounded, but generally, that\\'s handled automatically.\\n\\nLastly, I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted and valid.

      "Generated text: Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out which city is the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, but I should double-check that to make sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the administrative capital, though I think Lyon is the political one. But for this question, since they specified the capital, it's Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is one of the largest cities in France and also a very populous city in Europe. I think its population is around 2 million, but I'm not entirely sure. I should look up the most recent data to be accurate. From what I recall, as of 2023, Paris had a population of approximately 2,177,324 people. That number can vary slightly depending on the source and the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the city name and the population. So, I'll have a key for \"capital\" and its value as \"Paris\". Then another key for \"population\" with the number I found.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the string values should be in double quotes too. The keys should be in camelCase, so \"capital\" and \"population\". Also, the numbers shouldn't have commas, just the digits. \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n",
      "  \"population\": 2177324\n",
