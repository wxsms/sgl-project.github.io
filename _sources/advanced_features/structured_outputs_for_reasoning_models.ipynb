    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

I remember hearing that Paris is one of the most populous cities in Europe, but I'm not certain about the exact number. Maybe I should check some sources or think about recent growth. I think the population has been increasing over the years, so perhaps it's now over 3.5 million? I'm a bit confused because sometimes I hear different numbers, so I should make sure. Maybe I can recall that Paris has a metropolitan area that's much larger, but the city proper is around 3.5 million. I think I'll go with that for now.<br><br><br>content: Paris is the capital of France</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

Let me break this down. \\n\\nFirst, the user is asking for a specific piece of information, so I need to provide accurate data. I know that Paris is the capital of France, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format, so I\\'ll structure it properly. I\\'ll include an \"INF\" key for information and a \"POP\" key for population. \\n\\nI should make sure the population number is correct. From the latest sources, Paris has a population of around 2,143,000. Maybe I should confirm that exact figure. Let me think—yes, that\\'s correct as of recent estimates.\\n\\nI also need to format it neatly. Using proper JSON syntax, with an asterisk for multiplication if needed, but in this case, it\\'s just a number. \\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll note that the population figure is approximate because it can change over time due to various factors like migration, births, and deaths. That way, the user is informed about the source of the data and its potential variations.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with the keys \"INFI\" and \"POP\", the value for Paris under \"INFI\", and the population number under \"POP\". That should meet the user\\'s request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"INFI\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"POP\": 2143000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON structure contains the following information:\\n- \"INFI\": The name of the capital (\"Paris\").\\n- \"POP\": The population of the capital (an approximate number of 2,143,000).

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital city. So, that's straightforward. Next, I have to find the population. I'm not exactly sure about the current number, but I think it's around 2 million. Wait, no, that sounds too low. I remember hearing that Paris has a population over 3 million. Let me double-check that in my mind. Yes, Paris is a major city and its population is definitely in the millions. Maybe around 2.1 million? Or was it 2.2? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. Hmm, perhaps I should go with 2,100,000 as a safe estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data. I remember that JSON uses key-value pairs, so I'll need to create an object with keys like \"capital\" and \"population\". The values will be the respective data I've gathered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include the units for the population? Probably not necessary, as it's just a number. So, the JSON structure would look something like this: { \"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2100000 }. That seems straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the format. JSON requires that keys are in quotes and string values are also in quotes. So, making sure everything is properly enclosed. Also, the population number should be an integer, not a string, so 2100000 without quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else the user might need? They just asked for the information and population, so I think that's all. Maybe I should present it clearly so there's no confusion. Yeah, that should do it. I can send them the JSON object as the answer.\n",
