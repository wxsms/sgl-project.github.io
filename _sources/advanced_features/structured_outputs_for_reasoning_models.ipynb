    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '74ad34bf1ee94da7891a2e66a9ac1e76', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.3359415531158447, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766617180.6785936}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user just asked for a JSON format about the capital of France. Hmm, the capital is Paris, right? I need to gather accurate information on that. Let me think about what details are important. Population is a big one, so I\\'ll need to look up the most recent data. I know France\\'s population is around 40 million, but I\\'m not sure about Paris specifically. Is it about 21 million? I should double-check that.\\n\\nWait, maybe I\\'m mixing it up with Germany. No, Paris is definitely in the lower 20s in terms of population. Let me confirm... Yes, I think the population is usually around 21.55 million as of the latest estimates. Definitely important to get that right for the user to get reliable information.\\n\\nDo I need to include the metropolitan area or just the city proper? The user doesn\\'t specify, so I\\'ll stick to the city. Coordinates should be straightforward. Paris is at 48°51′N, 2°28′E. I\\'ll write that in degrees and decimal degrees format for accuracy.\\n\\nI should structure this into a JSON format. It should be a struct with \"capital\" as a string and \"population\" as a number. So something like {\"capital\": \"Paris, France\", \"population\": 21550000}. That looks clear and concise.\\n\\nAlso, I wonder why they asked for JSON specifically. Maybe they\\'re integrating this data into an app or website and need it programmatically. Ensuring accuracy is crucial because population data can change yearly. I\\'ll make sure the number is up-to-date and, if possible, cite the source or mention that it\\'s an estimate based on recent data.\\n\\nIs there anything else the user might need? They didn\\'t ask, but perhaps an additional note saying the population can change. That way, they know the figure might not be exactly current. \\n\\nSo putting it all together, I\\'ll format the response with the city name, population number, and coordinates. The population number should be written as a whole number to avoid confusion.

      "\n",
      "I should make sure to get the most recent population data. I recall that Paris's population was around 2.1 million in 2020, but I should double-check that to ensure accuracy. Also, I should include the city name, country, population number, and maybe the year for context.\n",
      "\n",
      "What format should I use? JSON is a common choice, so that's good. I'll structure it with a \"name\" key for the city, \"country\" for clarity, \"population\" as a number, and \"year\" to specify when the data was recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do I need to include any units? Probably not necessary since population numbers are typically in whole numbers. Also, formatting the number without commas for readability in some contexts, but in JSON, it's more about the structure than the presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted with correct syntax—commas in the right places and proper braces. Any typos could cause issues if they're parsing the JSON later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else they might need? They didn't specify, but maybe they want additional info like area or density, but since they only asked for population, I'll stick to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the JSON will have the keys and values I thought of, with accurate data. I'll present it clearly so there's no confusion.\n",
