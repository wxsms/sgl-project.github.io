    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '809fffb0a56042f0ba03438176adabf5', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.5058841705322266, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1767369193.020766}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me make sure I understand what they need. The capital of France is definitely Paris. So, my task is to provide the key details about Paris, specifically focusing on its population.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the current population of Paris. I remember that Paris has a large population, but I think it\\'s important to note that it\\'s a dynamic city with a mix of old and new. I should check if the population figure is up-to-date or if there are estimates. I believe the population figure I have is around 2.2 million as of the latest data, but I should double-check that to ensure accuracy. Alternatively, sometimes cities\\' populations are estimates, so I might want to mention that it\\'s an approximate figure.\\n\\nNext, I should consider what information to include in the JSON. The user specified to provide information and the population, so I\\'ll structure it with \" facts\" containing an object with details like the percentage of the population living in the City of Paris, its\\t\\t\\t  historical TfL (Hybrid Triple Lock) status, and average household income. These points give a comprehensive overview of Paris\\'s demography and socio-economic aspects.\\n\\nI should make the JSON clean and easy to read, so I\\'ll format it properly with commas separating the keys. Also, each sub-key should be descriptive to provide context. For example, the 63.9% figure indicates a significant portion of Parisians live in the City of Paris, which gives a sense of urban density.\\n\\nAdditionally, including the administrative information about Paris being the City of Paris and having a historical TfL status of 2019 (up to April) adds credibility and context. The average household income gives insight into the socio-economic status, which might be relevant depending on the user\\'s background.\\n\\nI should also note that this population figure is an estimate as of 2023 and might change over time. It\\'s good practice to mention any uncertainties or projections so users are aware of potential variations.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with all these elements, ensuring it\\'s well-formatted and easily parseable. I\\'ll keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any technical jargon that might confuse the user.\\n\\nBefore finalizing, I\\'ll review the JSON structure to make sure there are no syntax errors, like missing commas or brackets. It\\'s important that the JSON is valid so it can be used without issues in applications or databases.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is the user\\'s possible deeper needs. They might be a researcher, a student, or someone planning to move to Paris. Providing accurate and comprehensive data can help them make informed decisions regarding living, commuting, or investment opportunities.\\n\\nI might also think about adding other relevant metrics, but since the user specifically asked for population and information, I\\'ll stick to those. However, if more details were requested, that could be expanded. For this case, I\\'ll stick to the given requirement.\\n\\nIn summary, the JSON should offer a concise yet informative summary of Paris\\'s demographics and socio-economic indicators, ensuring it\\'s both accurate and useful for the user\\'s needs.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"estimated\": \"Approximately 2.2 million (as of 2023

Let me see, maybe it's a bit more precise. Oh yeah, I think it's approximately 2,170,000 as of 2023. That's the most recent figure I can remember.\n",
