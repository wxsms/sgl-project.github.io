    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I have this task where I need to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I need to identify the capital of France. I remember that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s the city in question.\\n\\nNext, I need to find out the population of Paris. I\\'m not exactly sure about the exact number, but I think it\\'s around 2 million. Wait, I think it was adjusted a bit recently. I believe the population of Paris has been growing, maybe around 2,150,000? Hmm, I\\'m not entirely certain. To be more accurate, I recall that in 2020, the population was approximately 2,158,000, but this might have changed since then.\\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll need to define keys that represent the necessary information. The user specified both information and population. So, I\\'ll have a \"name\" key for the city, a \"population\" key, and maybe a \"fact\" or \"description\" key to include some additional relevant information.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the structure might look like this:\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2158000,\\n  \"fact\": \"Paris is the capital city of France and has been its economic, political, and cultural center since at least the Middle Ages.\"\\n}\\n\\nI should double-check the population number to ensure accuracy. According to recent data, as of 2023, Paris\\' population is approximately 2,198,000. So, I\\'ll update the population number. \\n\\nWait, no, I think I might be mixing up the years. Let me confirm. In 2021, the population was around 2,198,000, and it\\'s projected to grow further. So, perhaps 2,198,000 is the correct number. However, sometimes population numbers can vary based on sources—some might use estimates, others exact counts.\\n\\nTo be precise, I could present it as \"approximately 2,198,000 as of 2021 figures.\" But since the task doesn\\'t specify a time frame, just providing the current population is fine.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I want to include a precise figure, I can look it up. Maybe a recent study or a reliable source would help. Without access to the internet, I\\'ll rely on my existing knowledge that Paris\\' population is over 2 million. For the sake of this response, I\\'ll go with 2,198,000.\\n\\nSo, the final JSON would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2198000,\\n  \"fact\": \"Paris is the capital city of France and has been its economic, political, and cultural center since the Middle Ages.\"\\n}\\n\\nI think this covers the necessary information clearly and concisely.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2198000,\\n  \"fact\": \"Paris is the capital city of France and has been its economic, political, and cultural center since the Middle Ages.\"\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 614, 419, 3383, 1380, 358, 1184, 311, 3410, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 911, 1246, 311, 5486, 419, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 279, 3283, 304, 3405, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 700, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 13, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 911, 279, 4734, 1372, 11, 714, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 13, 13824, 11, 358, 1744, 432, 572, 23368, 264, 2699, 5926, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 7196, 2163, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 30, 88190, 11, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 3654, 13, 2014, 387, 803, 13382, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 304, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 11, 279, 7042, 572, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 23, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 714, 419, 2578, 614, 5497, 2474, 1221, 382, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1184, 311, 6979, 6894, 429, 4009, 279, 5871, 1995, 13, 576, 1196, 5189, 2176, 1995, 323, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 614, 264, 330, 606, 1, 1376, 369, 279, 3283, 11, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 1376, 11, 323, 7196, 264, 330, 33110, 1, 476, 330, 4684, 1, 1376, 311, 2924, 1045, 5107, 9760, 1995, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 5944, 2578, 1401, 1075, 419, 510, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 23, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 33110, 788, 330, 59604, 374, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 323, 702, 1012, 1181, 6955, 11, 4948, 11, 323, 12752, 4126, 2474, 518, 3245, 279, 12592, 48993, 10040, 630, 40, 1265, 1990, 15934, 279, 7042, 1372, 311, 5978, 13403, 13, 10548, 311, 3213, 821, 11, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 12095, 6, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 24, 23, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 2647, 279, 7042, 1372, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 902, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 2578, 387, 26792, 705, 279, 1635, 13, 6771, 752, 7683, 13, 758, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 11, 279, 7042, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 11, 16, 24, 23, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 432, 594, 27348, 311, 3063, 4623, 13, 2055, 11, 8365, 220, 17, 11, 16, 24, 23, 11, 15, 15, 15, 374, 279, 4396, 1372, 13, 4354, 11, 7025, 7042, 5109, 646, 13289, 3118, 389, 8173, 2293, 14689, 2578, 990, 17530, 11, 3800, 4734, 14579, 382, 1249, 387, 23560, 11, 358, 1410, 3042, 432, 438, 330, 96736, 220, 17, 11, 16, 24, 23, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 12396, 1189, 1988, 2474, 279, 3383, 3171, 944, 13837, 264, 882, 4034, 11, 1101, 8241, 279, 1482, 7042, 374, 6915, 382, 92014, 11, 421, 358, 1366, 311, 2924, 264, 23560, 7071, 11, 358, 646, 1401, 432, 705, 13, 10696, 264, 3213, 3920, 476, 264, 14720, 2530, 1035, 1492, 13, 17147, 2615, 311, 279, 7602, 11, 358, 3278, 17188, 389, 847, 6350, 6540, 429, 12095, 6, 7042, 374, 916, 220, 17, 3526, 13, 1752, 279, 24483, 315, 419, 2033, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 220, 17, 11, 16, 24, 23, 11, 15, 15, 15, 382, 4416, 11, 279, 1590, 4718, 1035, 387, 1447, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 24, 23, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 33110, 788, 330, 59604, 374, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 323, 702, 1012, 1181, 6955, 11, 4948, 11, 323, 12752, 4126, 2474, 279, 12592, 48993, 10040, 630, 40, 1744, 419, 14521, 279, 5871, 1995, 9355, 323, 3529, 285, 974, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 24, 23, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 33110, 788, 330, 59604, 374, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 323, 702, 1012, 1181, 6955, 11, 4948, 11, 323, 12752, 4126, 2474, 279, 12592, 48993, 10040, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'bb18b225aa674b74a59e5b78f580096c', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 702, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.4612462520599365, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764840293.8394258}}</strong>"
