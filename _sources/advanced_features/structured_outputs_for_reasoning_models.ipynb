    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '9f89818803e14c0fab3d7d935d817961', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.2871029376983643, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763732827.7045288}}</strong>"

I\\'m not super familiar with every country, but I know France is a big country in Europe. I believe the capital is Paris, but I can\\'t be totally sure. It\\'s one of the most famous cities in the world, so that\\'s important. Paris is known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Les Invalides, and the Louvre Museum, so that makes sense.\\n\\nNow, about the population. I remember that capital cities usually have a large population. Paris must be one of the most populous cities in the world. I think the population is in the millions. Maybe around 20 or 30 million? I\\'m not sure exactly though. I think it might have been around 21 million a few years back, but population can increase over time. Maybe it\\'s around 22 million now? I should probably check that, but since I\\'m writing this out, I\\'ll just go with a reasonable estimate based on what I remember.\\n\\nWait, I think I\\'ve heard elsewhere that Paris has a population over 22 million, so maybe it\\'s around 22.2 million. That seems about right for a capital city. I don\\'t think it\\'s more than that because I\\'ve heard that French cities can sometimes be smaller, but Paris is an exception.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the capital is Paris, and the population is approximately 22.2 million. I should present this in a JSON format as requested.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 22200000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 323, 1181, 7042, 13, 358, 2776, 537, 2256, 11285, 448, 1449, 3146, 11, 714, 358, 1414, 9625, 374, 264, 2409, 3146, 304, 4505, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 714, 358, 646, 944, 387, 12473, 2704, 13, 1084, 594, 825, 315, 279, 1429, 11245, 9720, 304, 279, 1879, 11, 773, 429, 594, 2989, 13, 12095, 374, 3881, 369, 59924, 1075, 279, 468, 3092, 301, 21938, 11, 11615, 13882, 288, 11, 323, 279, 9729, 48506, 16328, 11, 773, 429, 3643, 5530, 382, 7039, 11, 911, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 6722, 9720, 5990, 614, 264, 3460, 7042, 13, 12095, 1969, 387, 825, 315, 279, 1429, 94451, 9720, 304, 279, 1879, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 7042, 374, 304, 279, 11728, 13, 10696, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 476, 220, 18, 15, 3526, 30, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 6896, 3498, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 2578, 614, 1012, 2163, 220, 17, 16, 3526, 264, 2421, 1635, 1182, 11, 714, 7042, 646, 5263, 916, 882, 13, 10696, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 17, 3526, 1431, 30, 358, 1265, 4658, 1779, 429, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 4378, 419, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 1101, 728, 448, 264, 13276, 16045, 3118, 389, 1128, 358, 6099, 382, 14190, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 6617, 17920, 429, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 916, 220, 17, 17, 3526, 11, 773, 7196, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 13, 2938, 4977, 911, 1290, 369, 264, 6722, 3283, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1744, 432, 594, 803, 1091, 429, 1576, 358, 3003, 6617, 429, 8585, 9720, 646, 7025, 387, 9155, 11, 714, 12095, 374, 458, 4683, 382, 4416, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 323, 279, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 17, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 13, 358, 1265, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 4718, 3561, 438, 11223, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 17, 17, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'bec9ad4383654787941e7f0e4a57d840', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 344, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.198420286178589, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763732844.1437304}}</strong>"

I remember that Paris is the capital, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact population number. I think it's a big city with millions of people, but I'm not certain about the specifics. Maybe I should look it up to confirm. \n",

      "I also recall that France's population is about 40 million, but the capital is just a part of that. So, Paris's population must be a fraction of the total national population. I'm not sure exactly how much. Maybe it's about 10% of the total? That would make it around 4 million, but I'm not certain. \n",

Maybe it's a bit higher or lower than what I initially thought. I'm not sure if it's 2 million, 3 million, or somewhere in between. \n",

      "I also wonder if there's a more precise way to find out the exact population. Maybe by checking the latest census data or recent reports from official sources like the French National Institute of Statistics and Registration (INSEE). That would give me the most accurate figure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I've heard that Paris is the most populous city in the EU. If it's the most populous, then its population should be higher than the national average. Since France's total population is around 40 million, if Paris is the most populous, it might be around 10-12 million. But I'm not sure if that's the case. \n",

      "I'm also considering that sometimes cities can have temporary populations, especially during events or holidays. But I don't think that's the case right now, so the number should be fairly accurate. \n",

      "In summary, I'm pretty confident that Paris is the capital of France and that its population is over 3 million. I'm leaning towards it being around 3.5 million, but I'm not entirely certain. To get the exact number, I should probably refer to a reliable source or check the latest data available. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I remember reading that the population of Paris is approximately 2.2 million. That seems lower than I thought. Maybe I was mistaken earlier. I should double-check that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, now I'm a bit confused because different sources might provide different estimates. Some might say 2 million, others 3 million. I need to find a source that provides the most recent and accurate population figure for Paris. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the best way to get the exact number is to look up the latest census data or official reports from organizations like INSEE. That way, I can be sure the information is accurate and up-to-date. \n",
