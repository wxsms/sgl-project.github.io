    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

That function will give me the current date and time in that location.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I need to use get_current_weather. The user is in New York, so I should provide the city as 'New York' and the state as 'NY' since that's the two-letter abbreviation. The unit should be Fahrenheit because the user didn't specify, but it's common for weather in the US. So I'll set unit to 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I need to make sure I call each function separately and include the parameters in the correct format. I'll structure each function call on its own line with the appropriate parameters. <br><br>Wait, does the get_current_weather function require all three parameters?

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '8064bb63dfbb4b939e738a83793a6395', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.629652500152588, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763912763.6694894}}</strong>"

But wait, what do they really want? They might be a student working on a project or maybe a casual person just curious about some data. Either way, providing accurate information is key.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the main points—name of the city, country, population, and maybe some other stats if possible. The user might want this data for a quick reference or integration into another application. JSON is a structured format, so I should make sure it\\'s well-formatted and easy to parse.\\n\\nI\\'ll start with the capital\\'s name, Paris, and the country France. It\\'s important to get these basics right. Next, the population. I remember that Paris is the most populous city in France, but exact numbers can change yearly. I\\'ll have to check the latest data to provide the most accurate figure. Let me think, I believe the population is around 2.1 million as of recent estimates. \\n\\nI should also consider including other relevant data like the geographic area—maybe the city\\'s urbanized area in square kilometers to give a sense of its size. Adding the metropolitan area population could add more context. Including GDP and some notable landmarks might be helpful if the user is looking for comprehensive information for a report or presentation.\\n\\nWait, should I include all that? The user just asked for the capital\\'s info and population. Perhaps sticking to the essentials is better unless they ask for more. But to be thorough, adding a few related stats might make the JSON more useful. I\\'ll include population growth rate, which gives insight into its demographic trends. Also, the metropolitan area population can show how much Paris extends beyond its city limits.\\n\\nIncluding the GDP rank is a bit more specific, but it might be useful for economic context. Landmarks are also a nice touch for those who might be exploring or writing about the city. So, I\\'ll list those under \" landmarks\" for easy access.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together in the JSON structure, making sure each field is clear and concise. I\\'ll follow the example they provided, using keys like \"capitalName,\" \"countryName,\" \"population,\" and others for clarity. This way, the user can parse the JSON without any issues.\\n\\nI should also double-check the population numbers to ensure accuracy to avoid misinformation. Maybe look up the latest data to confirm the exact figure, but I think 2.1 million is pretty standard. If it\\'s an ongoing process, perhaps I can note that the population is subject to change.\\n\\nOverall, the goal is to provide a clear, well-structured JSON response that\\'s both informative and easy to use for the user\\'s needs. I\\'ll prepare the response accordingly, making sure it\\'s accurate and helpful regardless of how they intend to use the data.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France structured in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capitalName\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"countryName\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": 2161000,  // Approximately 2.161 million as of 2023 estimates\\n
