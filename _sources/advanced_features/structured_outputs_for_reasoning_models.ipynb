    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'f6ea95161145450ea8c6d69029db9d87', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.430373430252075, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763699042.9346714}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I have to figure out how to respond to this query where the user is asking for the population of the capital of France. Hmm, the capital is Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population must be quite large. But I don\\'t remember the exact number. I think it\\'s in the millions. Let me think... I recall something about it being over 3 million. Maybe 3,500,000? Or was it more? I\\'m not sure. \\n\\nWait, maybe I should recall some information about France\\'s population. I think the country\\'s population is around 67 million. If Paris is the capital, it should be the largest city, so it\\'s a significant portion of that total. If the country\\'s population is 67 million and Paris is the biggest, maybe 3 million is a bit low. Could it be closer to 4 million? I\\'m a bit uncertain. \\n\\nI should also consider how the population is calculated. Is it the urban area population or the metro area? Sometimes capitals are looked at in a broader sense. Paris has a metro area population that\\'s over 12 million. But 10 million sounds too high for just the city proper. So maybe something around 3-4 million?\\n\\nWait, I think I\\'ve heard before that Paris\\' population is approximately 3.5 million. That makes sense because other major cities in France, like Lyon or Toulouse, have populations in the hundreds of thousands, so 3.5 million for Paris would surpass them. Also, when I think about Paris landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, I imagine a large city with a significant population to support all that tourism and infrastructure.\\n\\nMoreover, if I check the recently updated data, what is the most accurate figure? From what I can recall, the population was around 2.2 million a few decades ago, but it must have grown with the city\\'s development. So, yeah, I think 3,503,000 is a commonly cited figure. That seems precise enough, considering the city\\'s significant growth over time. \\n\\nI guess I\\'m pretty confident with that number. To be sure, I could refer to official sources, but since I don\\'t have access right now, I\\'ll go with 3,503,000 as the population of Paris, the capital of France.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3503000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 614, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 5889, 311, 419, 3239, 1380, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 88190, 11, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 1969, 387, 5008, 3460, 13, 1988, 358, 1513, 944, 6099, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 304, 279, 11728, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 1112, 358, 19091, 2494, 911, 432, 1660, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 10696, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 30, 2521, 572, 432, 803, 30, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 7196, 358, 1265, 19091, 1045, 1995, 911, 9625, 594, 7042, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 3146, 594, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 21, 22, 3526, 13, 1416, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 432, 1265, 387, 279, 7772, 3283, 11, 773, 432, 594, 264, 5089, 13348, 315, 429, 2790, 13, 1416, 279, 3146, 594, 7042, 374, 220, 21, 22, 3526, 323, 12095, 374, 279, 8538, 11, 7196, 220, 18, 3526, 374, 264, 2699, 3347, 13, 16503, 432, 387, 12128, 311, 220, 19, 3526, 30, 358, 2776, 264, 2699, 35118, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 1246, 279, 7042, 374, 16588, 13, 2160, 432, 279, 15662, 3082, 7042, 476, 279, 33482, 3082, 30, 17688, 92999, 525, 6966, 518, 304, 264, 26829, 5530, 13, 12095, 702, 264, 33482, 3082, 7042, 429, 594, 916, 220, 16, 17, 3526, 13, 1988, 220, 16, 15, 3526, 10362, 2238, 1550, 369, 1101, 279, 3283, 6169, 13, 2055, 7196, 2494, 2163, 220, 18, 12, 19, 3526, 1939, 14190, 11, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 6617, 1573, 429, 12095, 6, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 13, 2938, 3643, 5530, 1576, 1008, 3598, 9720, 304, 9625, 11, 1075, 55201, 476, 350, 66630, 11, 614, 21910, 304, 279, 11499, 315, 9037, 11, 773, 220, 18, 13, 20, 3526, 369, 12095, 1035, 52020, 1105, 13, 7281, 11, 979, 358, 1744, 911, 12095, 59924, 11, 1075, 279, 468, 3092, 301, 21938, 323, 279, 9729, 48506, 11, 358, 12793, 264, 3460, 3283, 448, 264, 5089, 7042, 311, 1824, 678, 429, 30983, 323, 13737, 382, 57176, 11, 421, 358, 1779, 279, 5926, 6049, 821, 11, 1128, 374, 279, 1429, 13382, 7071, 30, 5542, 1128, 358, 646, 19091, 11, 279, 7042, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 264, 2421, 10793, 4134, 11, 714, 432, 1969, 614, 14700, 448, 279, 3283, 594, 4401, 13, 2055, 11, 21639, 11, 358, 1744, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 18, 11, 15, 15, 15, 374, 264, 16626, 21870, 7071, 13, 2938, 4977, 23560, 3322, 11, 12831, 279, 3283, 594, 5089, 6513, 916, 882, 13, 4710, 40, 7942, 358, 2776, 5020, 16506, 448, 429, 1372, 13, 2014, 387, 2704, 11, 358, 1410, 8300, 311, 3946, 8173, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 1513, 944, 614, 2615, 1290, 1431, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 18, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 18, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '1c97ab0a5dbe42fa9c90c8000bd988b1', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 529, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.356454610824585, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763699062.8896353}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They asked, \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's the city in question. Next, I need to find the population. I'm not exactly sure of the current number, but I think it's around 3.5 million. Wait, I should double-check that. From what I remember, the population has been increasing over the years, so maybe it's a bit higher now. Let me think—yes, I believe it's approximately 3.5 million people as of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I'll need to create an object with relevant fields. The user specified \"information and population,\" so I should include both. Maybe I can have an \"information\" field that describes Paris and a \"population\" field with the number. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using curly braces for the object, commas to separate the key-value pairs, and proper quotation marks. Let me outline it: a main object with \"capital_information\" and \"population\" keys. Under each, I'll provide the respective details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include more details in the information? Maybe a brief description of Paris's location, status as the capital, and a notable landmark like the Eiffel Tower. That would make the information more comprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should present this in a clear and concise manner. The user didn't specify the need for additional information, so sticking to the basics is probably best. I don't want to overwhelm them with unnecessary data unless it's relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is the formatting. JSON requires precise syntax, so I need to ensure there are no typos or missing commas. Each key should be in quotes, and the entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this:\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"capital_information\": \"Paris is the capital city of France. It is located in the northern part of the country, known for its rich history, landmarks, and cultural significance.\",\n",
      "  \"population\": \"3.5 million\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers the user's request. They asked for the information and population in JSON, so this should fulfill their needs. I should also make sure that the population number is up to date and accurate, maybe cross-referencing it with recent sources or official statistics to confirm it's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, just to be safe, I'll check the population again. A quick mental note: I think Paris has a population around 3.5 to 4 million. Since 2020, it's been growing a bit each year. So 3.5 million in 2023 sounds accurate. I'll stick with that number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll present the JSON without any additional text, as per the user's example, keeping it straightforward.\n",
      "</think>\n",
