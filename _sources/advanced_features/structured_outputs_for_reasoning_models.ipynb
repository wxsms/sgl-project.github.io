    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I know that the user is in New York, so the timezone is already set for them. That means when I request the current date and time, I should specify the timezone as 'America/New_York'.

Since the user is in New York, I need to provide the city and state. New York's full name is 'New York', but I think the city is 'New York' and the state is 'NY'. The unit for temperature isn't specified, so I'll default to Fahrenheit since that's a common unit used in the US. So the function call for weather would be <function=get_current_weather '{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}></function>.<br><br>Now, I should make sure to only use one function at a time, as per the instructions.

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out what the user is asking for here. They wrote, \"Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.\" Let me break this down. \\n\\nFirst, the capital of France is Paris, right? So that\\'s pretty straightforward. The user is asking for information about Paris and its population, presented in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to represent data structures in a readable format. It\\'s commonly used for data exchange between a server and a web application.\\n\\nI need to make sure I include all necessary information. They mentioned \"information and population,\" which could mean a few things. Maybe just the current population, or maybe other details like area, landmarks, or notable people. I should clarify what \"information\" refers to. Since the user didn\\'t specify, I\\'ll assume they want basic info along with the population.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ll structure the JSON with a key indicating the data and include the population as a nested object under a \"population\" key. Maybe include some related terms like \"nom\" for name and \"surface\" for area. That seems comprehensive.\\n\\nI also need to present the population with the correct number. I remember the population of Paris is over 3 million. I should provide the approximate figure, maybe around 2,155,000, as a rounded figure. I should also include the growth rate, which I think is about 1.4% as of 2023, to give a sense of the city\\'s demographic trends.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a main object with a title, a category, and a data section containing the population and related info. Then, a separate object for the population fact to make it clear. That way, it\\'s well-organized and easy to read.\\n\\nI think that covers everything the user asked for. They wanted the info in JSON, so this structure should meet their needs. I should make sure it\\'s properly formatted so there are no syntax errors. Also, it\\'s good to keep the response concise and to the point since the user specifically asked for information without any additional fluff.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"title\": \"Capital of France\",\\n  \"category\": \"Demographics\",\\n  \"data\": {\\n    \"capital\": {\\n      \"nom\": \"Paris\",\\n      \"sample\": \"Main city and political center of France\",\\n      \"surface\": \"12.51 km²\",\\n      \"timezone\": \"Europe/Paris\"\\n    },\\n    \"population\": {\\n      \"fact\": \"As of 2023, the population of Paris is approximately 2,155,000 people.\",\\n      \"growth_rate\": \"1.4% (approx.)\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1128, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 1588, 13, 2379, 6139, 11, 330, 35127, 752, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 279, 4718, 3561, 1189, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 4710, 5338, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 1290, 30, 2055, 429, 594, 5020, 30339, 13, 576, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 1995, 911, 12095, 323, 1181, 7042, 11, 10449, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 13352, 369, 12914, 3002, 2806, 367, 11, 892, 374, 264, 1616, 311, 4009, 821, 14389, 304, 264, 33798, 3561, 13, 1084, 594, 16626, 1483, 369, 821, 9289, 1948, 264, 3538, 323, 264, 3482, 3766, 382, 40, 1184, 311, 1281, 2704, 358, 2924, 678, 5871, 1995, 13, 2379, 9733, 330, 25069, 323, 7042, 1335, 892, 1410, 3076, 264, 2421, 2513, 13, 10696, 1101, 279, 1482, 7042, 11, 476, 7196, 1008, 3565, 1075, 3082, 11, 59924, 11, 476, 27190, 1251, 13, 358, 1265, 37163, 1128, 330, 25069, 1, 19257, 311, 13, 8704, 279, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 807, 1366, 6770, 3546, 3156, 448, 279, 7042, 382, 4416, 11, 358, 3278, 5944, 279, 4718, 448, 264, 1376, 18860, 279, 821, 323, 2924, 279, 7042, 438, 264, 24034, 1633, 1212, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 1376, 13, 10696, 2924, 1045, 5435, 3793, 1075, 330, 16687, 1, 369, 829, 323, 330, 39746, 1, 369, 3082, 13, 2938, 4977, 15817, 382, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 279, 7042, 448, 279, 4396, 1372, 13, 358, 6099, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 374, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 358, 1265, 3410, 279, 44868, 7071, 11, 7196, 2163, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 20, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 438, 264, 17976, 7071, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 2924, 279, 6513, 4379, 11, 892, 358, 1744, 374, 911, 220, 16, 13, 19, 4, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 311, 2968, 264, 5530, 315, 279, 3283, 594, 37362, 18339, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 1887, 1633, 448, 264, 2265, 11, 264, 5582, 11, 323, 264, 821, 3772, 8482, 279, 7042, 323, 5435, 3546, 13, 5005, 11, 264, 8651, 1633, 369, 279, 7042, 2097, 311, 1281, 432, 2797, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 432, 594, 1632, 12, 62216, 323, 4135, 311, 1349, 382, 40, 1744, 429, 14521, 4297, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 13, 2379, 4829, 279, 3546, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 5944, 1265, 3367, 862, 3880, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 432, 594, 10277, 23126, 773, 1052, 525, 902, 19482, 5975, 13, 7281, 11, 432, 594, 1661, 311, 2506, 279, 2033, 63594, 323, 311, 279, 1459, 2474, 279, 1196, 11689, 4588, 369, 1995, 2041, 894, 5107, 1320, 1362, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 2102, 788, 330, 63593, 315, 9625, 756, 220, 330, 5471, 788, 330, 32003, 44145, 756, 220, 330, 691, 788, 341, 262, 330, 65063, 788, 341, 414, 330, 16687, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 414, 330, 13611, 788, 330, 6202, 3283, 323, 4948, 4126, 315, 9625, 756, 414, 330, 39746, 788, 330, 16, 17, 13, 20, 16, 13136, 29456, 756, 414, 330, 43271, 788, 330, 30780, 14, 59604, 698, 262, 1153, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 341, 414, 330, 33110, 788, 330, 2121, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 374, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 20, 11, 15, 15, 15, 1251, 10346, 414, 330, 73089, 9246, 788, 330, 16, 13, 19, 4, 320, 48053, 6138, 698, 262, 456, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '9fb08ee233fc4cc690d73cd35a74c669', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 600, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.822939395904541, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1765935162.480073}}</strong>"
