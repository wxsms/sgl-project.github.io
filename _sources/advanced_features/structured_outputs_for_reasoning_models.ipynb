    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'ad9823d6f1a745d5a5f845d8bcc2ffd6', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.900303363800049, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766205378.8942041}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user\\'s query. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, the capital of France is Paris, right? So I should start by confirming that.\\n\\nNext, I need to gather accurate data about Paris\\'s population. I remember that populations can change over time, so I should check the latest available data. I think as of 2023, the population is around 2.16 million. But wait, I should make sure that\\'s correct. Maybe I can cross-reference it with official sources or recent reports.\\n\\nAlso, the user mentioned including a map image. I\\'m not entirely sure how to do that in JSON, but I think it\\'s possible to include a data URL for an image. I\\'ll need to look up a reliable source that provides a population map or perhaps use a placeholder image if that\\'s not feasible.\\n\\nThe user also wants the information and population in JSON format. So I should structure it with proper keys. Maybe \"capital\" and \"population\" as top-level keys, and under \"population,\" include the number and a map image if available.\\n\\nHmm, I should think about any potential issues. For example, the population number might vary slightly depending on the source and the year it\\'s recorded. It\\'s important to use a recent and accurate figure. Also, ensuring that the map image has the correct license and permissions is crucial if I\\'m going to link it publicly.\\n\\nWait, is the population for Paris only the Mayor\\'s Office of Public Services figure? I should check their official website or press release to confirm the exact number. Let me see, according to the latest data from 2022, the population was about 2,160,000, but it\\'s always good to verify if there have been recent updates.\\n\\nAs for the JSON structure, I\\'ll make sure it\\'s valid. Each key should be in quotes, and string values should also be in quotes. Numbers don\\'t need quotes, so population will be an integer. The map part can be a bit tricky, but using a placeholder image URL might work if I can\\'t find a direct link.\\n\\nI should also consider if the user needs more details, like administrative divisions or neighboring areas, but since they specifically asked for the capital, I\\'ll stick to that. Maybe in a follow-up, I can offer additional information if needed.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with \"capital\" as \"Paris,\" \"population\" as the number, and add a \"map\" key with the image URL. I\\'ll make sure the JSON is properly formatted to avoid any errors.\\n\\nDouble-checking everything, I think that covers the user\\'s request comprehensively.

      "First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, no doubt about that. So that's straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city and has a large population, but I'm not exactly sure about the current number. I think it's around 2 million, but maybe it's a bit more now. I should check that. Oh, wait, the user's previous answer mentioned 2,165,822 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll need to define the keys appropriately. The user mentioned \"information\" and \"population,\" so I'll include both. For population, it's just a number, so I'll make sure it's an integer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any other details the user might find useful. They might want more than just the population, maybe some key facts or the city's significance. But the user specifically asked for information and population, so I'll stick to those.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted, with correct syntax, colons, and commas. Any mistake there would make it invalid. For example, ensuring that each key is in quotes and the values are correctly placed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the user's possible scenario. They might be a student working on a project, or maybe a researcher looking for quick data. Either way, providing accurate and concise information is key. They didn't specify a need for more details, so I'll keep it straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I'll present the JSON in a clear and readable manner. Maybe I'll format it with proper indentation so it's easy to read, even though they just need it in JSON format. That way, they can copy it directly without issues.\n",
