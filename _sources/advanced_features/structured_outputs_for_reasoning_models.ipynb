    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

I think the population has been increasing over the years, so perhaps it's now over 3.5 million? I'm a bit confused because sometimes I hear different numbers, so I should make sure. Maybe I can recall that Paris has a metropolitan area that's much larger, but the city proper is around 3.5 million. I think I'll go with that for now.<br><br><br>content: Paris is the capital of France</strong>"

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out the correct JSON format for the information and population of France\\'s capital, which is Paris. First, I should recall what the JSON format entails—it’s a way to structure data using key-value pairs inside curly braces. \\n\\nI know that Paris is the capital, so the key should be something like \"capital\" and the value would be \"Paris\". Next, I need the population. I\\'m not exactly sure about the current figure, but I think it\\'s around 2 million. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, was there a recent census or a reliable source that could give me the exact number? I remember seeing some articles stating the population as approximately 2.1 or 2.2 million. To be precise, I think the most recent official data from 2021 puts it at about 2,175,000 people. \\n\\nSo, the structure would be an object with keys like \"country,\" \"capital,\" and \"population.\" Each key maps to its corresponding value. I should make sure the keys are in English, which is manageable. Also, the numbers should be formatted correctly, probably without commas for readability if it\\'s within a reasonable range.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2175000\\n}\\n\\nI need to ensure commas are correctly placed in the string values, and the numbers are accurate. I don\\'t see any immediate errors, but I should consider if there are any additional fields that might be relevant, but the user specifically asked for population along with the capital and country name, so those three should suffice.\\n\\nI should also format it correctly, using double quotes for strings and proper syntax to avoid any errors when the JSON is parsed. Maybe I can simulate how someone might use this JSON, like in a programming context, to ensure it\\'s valid. \\n\\nIn summary, the JSON will have three key-value pairs: country is France, capital is Paris, and population is 2,175,000. That should cover everything the user asked for.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the JSON format for the information and population of the capital of France:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2175000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 4396, 4718, 3561, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 9625, 594, 6722, 11, 892, 374, 12095, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1265, 19091, 1128, 279, 4718, 3561, 70104, 43503, 748, 264, 1616, 311, 5944, 821, 1667, 1376, 19083, 13530, 4766, 68103, 59191, 13, 4710, 40, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 279, 1376, 1265, 387, 2494, 1075, 330, 65063, 1, 323, 279, 897, 1035, 387, 330, 59604, 3263, 9295, 11, 358, 1184, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 911, 279, 1482, 7071, 11, 714, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 572, 1052, 264, 3213, 43602, 476, 264, 14720, 2530, 429, 1410, 2968, 752, 279, 4734, 1372, 30, 358, 6099, 9120, 1045, 9709, 27798, 279, 7042, 438, 13187, 220, 17, 13, 16, 476, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 13, 2014, 387, 23560, 11, 358, 1744, 279, 1429, 3213, 3946, 821, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 9521, 432, 518, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 20, 11, 15, 15, 15, 1251, 13, 4710, 4416, 11, 279, 5944, 1035, 387, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 11141, 1335, 330, 65063, 1335, 323, 330, 44441, 1189, 8886, 1376, 14043, 311, 1181, 12159, 897, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 11, 892, 374, 70028, 13, 7281, 11, 279, 5109, 1265, 387, 23126, 12440, 11, 4658, 2041, 76602, 369, 91494, 421, 432, 594, 2878, 264, 13276, 2088, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 1075, 419, 1447, 515, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 20, 15, 15, 15, 198, 630, 40, 1184, 311, 5978, 76602, 525, 12440, 9099, 304, 279, 914, 2750, 11, 323, 279, 5109, 525, 13382, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1490, 894, 13922, 5975, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 2908, 421, 1052, 525, 894, 5107, 5043, 429, 2578, 387, 9760, 11, 714, 279, 1196, 11689, 4588, 369, 7042, 3156, 448, 279, 6722, 323, 3146, 829, 11, 773, 1846, 2326, 1265, 76156, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 3561, 432, 12440, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 6169, 19482, 311, 5648, 894, 5975, 979, 279, 4718, 374, 15676, 13, 10696, 358, 646, 37453, 1246, 4325, 2578, 990, 419, 4718, 11, 1075, 304, 264, 15473, 2266, 11, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 13, 4710, 641, 12126, 11, 279, 4718, 686, 614, 2326, 1376, 19083, 13530, 25, 3146, 374, 9625, 11, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 323, 7042, 374, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 20, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 1265, 3421, 4297, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 4718, 3561, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 20, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '4c168b4504684a4caaa0e56490f4232f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 500, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.056013584136963, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1770073363.4837248}}</strong>"
