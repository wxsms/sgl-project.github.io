    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'a10bf85034ca469282598b1a37d602cf', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3656158447265625, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1768315198.9948626}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I just received a user request asking for the capital of France and its population in JSON format. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I need to make sure I understand what the user is asking for. They want information about the capital city, specifically its name, and also the population. \\n\\nAlright, so the capital of France is definitely Paris. I remember that because it\\'s a very well-known fact. But I should double-check that to be sure, just in case. Maybe I can quickly recall or think if there\\'s any other major city that\\'s capital? No, Paris it is.\\n\\nNext, the population. I\\'m not an expert, but I think Paris has a population in the millions. Let me try to recall. I remember it being around 2 million. Wait, no, that sounds too low. Maybe 3 million? Hmm, I\\'m a bit unsure. I might have heard it as 2.2 million a few years back, but I\\'m not confident about the exact number.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to represent data structures. It\\'s commonly used in web applications. So I\\'ll need to format the information accordingly. The keys should be \"capital\" and \"population\". The value for \"capital\" will be the string \"Paris\", and \"population\" will be the integer 2200000. But wait, is the population exact? Probably not. Demographics can change, so I should note that it\\'s an approximate figure.\\n\\nI also want to make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Using double quotes around the keys and string values, and commas correctly placed between the key-value pairs. Oh, and don\\'t forget the opening and closing brackets.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look like this: { \"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2200000 }. I think that covers the user\\'s request accurately. I should also mention that the population is approximate to avoid overreliance on the exact number, which might change over time.\\n\\nWait, should I include any units? Like, population in thousands or millions? Probably not necessary in JSON unless specified, as it\\'s more of a data structure.

      "Now, I should gather the population data. I remember that as of recent estimates, Paris has a population around 2 million. But wait, I should check if that's the most current number. Population figures can change yearly due to births, deaths, and migration. Maybe I should look up the latest data to be accurate. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the population is approximately 2,150,000 as of 2023. I'll go with that number. It's a good balance between up-to-date and not too large a number to handle in JSON.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, structuring this information into JSON. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll need to decide on the keys. The main pieces of information are the city name and the population number. So the keys would be \"city\" and \"population\". \n",

      "Putting it all together, I'll present the JSON as the answer. I should keep it simple and clear, just the information the user requested without any extra details.\n",

      "Just to double-check, Paris's population is indeed around 2.15 million. I don't think it's necessary to include additional fields unless specified, so keeping it straightforward is best.\n",
