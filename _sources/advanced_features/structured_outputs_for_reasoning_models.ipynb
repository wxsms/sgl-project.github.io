    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '5f0f6709dd7a498999123058b21c463d', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.705646753311157, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763422811.8712459}}</strong>"

First, I need to figure out what exactly they are looking for. They want a JSON structure, which means I have to provide accurate and clear data within a JSON object.\\n\\nI know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s a given, but maybe I should double-check to make sure it\\'s correct. Paris has been the capital for a long time, so I don\\'t think there\\'s any confusion there. Next, I need to find the population. I recall that Paris is a very populous city, maybe around 2 million? Let me think more precisely. I remember that the population was around 2.1 million a few years back. I should verify if that\\'s the latest number. \\n\\nWait, no, I think it\\'s now over 2.2 million. Let me see. I know that major French cities like Paris, Marseille, and Lille are in the 2 million range. Given that, I should present the population as approximately 2,200,000 or 2.2 million, but to keep it simple for the user, maybe just 2 million is sufficient unless precision is required.\\n\\nAlso, should I include other relevant information about Paris? The user might want more details, but since they specifically asked for the capital, I think sticking to population and the city\\'s name is appropriate. So I\\'ll structure the JSON with an \"。(Capital)\" key containing \"Paris\" and a \"Population\" key with the number. \\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct to avoid any errors. So, commas and brackets are in the right place. Maybe present it neatly for readability. That way, the user gets the information clearly and efficiently without any confusion.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2200000  // Approximately 2.2 million as of recent estimates\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1128, 6896, 807, 525, 3330, 369, 13, 2379, 1366, 264, 4718, 5944, 11, 892, 3363, 358, 614, 311, 3410, 13382, 323, 2797, 821, 2878, 264, 4718, 1633, 382, 40, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 264, 2661, 11, 714, 7196, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 311, 1281, 2704, 432, 594, 4396, 13, 12095, 702, 1012, 279, 6722, 369, 264, 1293, 882, 11, 773, 358, 1513, 944, 1744, 1052, 594, 894, 21340, 1052, 13, 9295, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 19091, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 1602, 94451, 3283, 11, 7196, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 30, 6771, 752, 1744, 803, 23638, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 572, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 3526, 264, 2421, 1635, 1182, 13, 358, 1265, 10146, 421, 429, 594, 279, 5535, 1372, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 902, 11, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 1431, 916, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 3598, 8585, 9720, 1075, 12095, 11, 87693, 11, 323, 444, 4517, 525, 304, 279, 220, 17, 3526, 2088, 13, 16246, 429, 11, 358, 1265, 3042, 279, 7042, 438, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 17, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 476, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 311, 2506, 432, 4285, 369, 279, 1196, 11, 7196, 1101, 220, 17, 3526, 374, 14016, 7241, 16052, 374, 2567, 382, 13394, 11, 1265, 358, 2924, 1008, 9760, 1995, 911, 12095, 30, 576, 1196, 2578, 1366, 803, 3565, 11, 714, 2474, 807, 11689, 4588, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 358, 1744, 36972, 311, 7042, 323, 279, 3283, 594, 829, 374, 8311, 13, 2055, 358, 3278, 5944, 279, 4718, 448, 458, 330, 96899, 63593, 9940, 1376, 8482, 330, 59604, 1, 323, 264, 330, 53371, 1, 1376, 448, 279, 1372, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 311, 5648, 894, 5975, 13, 2055, 11, 76602, 323, 38929, 525, 304, 279, 1290, 1992, 13, 10696, 3042, 432, 62166, 369, 91494, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 5221, 279, 1995, 9355, 323, 29720, 2041, 894, 21340, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 17, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 220, 442, 78804, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 438, 315, 3213, 17530, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '0a8ac4feaa2741279d4c171ad606033a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 425, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.7136647701263428, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763422829.9602501}}</strong>"

      "\n",
      "Generated text: Alright, I just saw the user's query asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to figure out what exactly the user is asking for. The capital of France is definitely Paris, so that's straightforward. Now, they want this information in JSON format, which is a data structure that's commonly used in web applications. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, so I should structure the data accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user mentioned \"information and population.\" I'm assuming they want both the population number and some key information about the city. Key information might include the administrative region, maybe the timezone, and the official website. These are standard pieces of data that usually accompany a city's profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, thinking about the population. I know that population numbers can change over time due to various factors like birth rates, death rates, and migration. The user might not care about the exact current number, but perhaps an approximate figure based on recent data. I should double-check the latest estimates. As of 2023, Paris has a population of around 2.2 million. However, it's important to note that this number can fluctuate, so maybe I should mention that the figure is approximate and can change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to structure this into a JSON object. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"capital\" for the city name, \"administrative Region\" for its department, \"timezone\" in UTC, and \"official Website.\" Under each key, I'll place the respective information. For the population, I'll include it as a number and also add a note about the approximate nature of the figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure the JSON is properly formatted. Each key should be in quotes, and the values should be correctly placed. If there are any commas, they should be in the right places to avoid syntax errors. Since JSON doesn't allow trailing commas, I'll ensure that the formatting is clean and follows standard conventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the user's possible needs, they might be looking for a simple data structure to display on a website or integrate into an application. They might not have specified a particular format beyond JSON, so I should keep it straightforward without any additional fluff.\n",
