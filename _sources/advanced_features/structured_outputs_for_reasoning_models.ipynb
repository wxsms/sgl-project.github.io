    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",
    "- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '411abc1fbd3041d28de63cc2941e7e3a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3535454273223877, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763173058.777838}}</strong>"

The capital is Paris, so I\\'ll need to gather accurate data on its population and other relevant details. \\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll check the current global population estimates. However, Paris is a large city, so its population is just a fraction of the global total. I\\'ll look up the latest data from sources like the World Bank or recent censuses. Let\\'s say as of 2023, the population is around 2.2 million.\\n\\nNext, I should include some key facts about Paris to provide a more comprehensive response. Paris is known for its rich history, being the capital, home to the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower, and its influence in arts, literature, and fashion. It\\'s also a global city with a vibrant cultural scene.\\n\\nI need to structure this information clearly in JSON format. Maybe a top-level key like \"CityInfo\" containing properties such as \"Population\" with its numeric value and \"InterestingFacts\" as an array of strings. \\n\\nI also want to make the response more interactive, so adding a sphinx command at the end would be helpful. This command allows users to ask more questions in a more natural conversational way.\\n\\nLet me put it all together. The JSON should summarize Paris\\'s population, include a few key facts, and end with the sphinx prompt. Keeping the language clear and concise, ensuring the JSON is properly formatted without any syntax errors.\\n\\nDouble-checking the population figure for accuracy is crucial. Maybe cross-referencing a few sources to confirm the number is correct. Also, ensuring that the interesting facts are accurate and reflect Paris\\'s significance.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON with proper indentation and structure for readability. Adding the sphinx command at the end makes it user-friendly for further interaction.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"CityInfo\": {\\n    \"Capital\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"Population\": 2192000,\\n    \"InterestingFacts\": [\\n      \"Paris is the capital city of France and has been its official capital since 1998.\",\\n      \"It is known for its rich history, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and its influence in arts, literature, and fashion.\",\\n      \"Paris is often referred to as the \\'City of Light,\\' \\'The City of Love,\\' and \\'Thetml资本 of the World.\\'\"\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can use this JSON data to display information about Paris using a sphinx prompt, for example:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ sphinx \"What is the population of the capital of France?\"\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 15102, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1184, 311, 9567, 13382, 821, 389, 1181, 7042, 323, 1008, 9760, 3565, 13, 4710, 5338, 11, 358, 3278, 1779, 279, 1482, 3644, 7042, 17530, 13, 4354, 11, 12095, 374, 264, 3460, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 1101, 264, 19419, 315, 279, 3644, 2790, 13, 358, 3278, 1401, 705, 279, 5535, 821, 504, 8173, 1075, 279, 4337, 8547, 476, 3213, 272, 724, 4776, 13, 6771, 594, 1977, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 17, 3526, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1265, 2924, 1045, 1376, 13064, 911, 12095, 311, 3410, 264, 803, 15817, 2033, 13, 12095, 374, 3881, 369, 1181, 9080, 3840, 11, 1660, 279, 6722, 11, 2114, 311, 279, 9729, 48506, 323, 279, 468, 3092, 301, 21938, 11, 323, 1181, 10173, 304, 18560, 11, 17206, 11, 323, 11153, 13, 1084, 594, 1083, 264, 3644, 3283, 448, 264, 32976, 12752, 6109, 382, 40, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 9355, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 10696, 264, 1909, 11591, 1376, 1075, 330, 12730, 1731, 1, 8482, 5888, 1741, 438, 330, 53371, 1, 448, 1181, 24064, 897, 323, 330, 84315, 37, 11359, 1, 438, 458, 1334, 315, 9069, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1366, 311, 1281, 279, 2033, 803, 20753, 11, 773, 7842, 264, 41722, 20014, 3210, 518, 279, 835, 1035, 387, 10950, 13, 1096, 3210, 6147, 3847, 311, 2548, 803, 4755, 304, 264, 803, 5810, 7517, 1663, 1616, 382, 10061, 752, 2182, 432, 678, 3786, 13, 576, 4718, 1265, 62079, 12095, 594, 7042, 11, 2924, 264, 2421, 1376, 13064, 11, 323, 835, 448, 279, 41722, 20014, 9934, 13, 55378, 279, 4128, 2797, 323, 63594, 11, 22573, 279, 4718, 374, 10277, 23126, 2041, 894, 19482, 5975, 382, 7378, 15934, 287, 279, 7042, 7071, 369, 13403, 374, 16587, 13, 10696, 5312, 5504, 802, 11373, 264, 2421, 8173, 311, 7683, 279, 1372, 374, 4396, 13, 7281, 11, 22573, 429, 279, 7040, 13064, 525, 13382, 323, 8708, 12095, 594, 25361, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 69592, 323, 5944, 369, 91494, 13, 30370, 279, 41722, 20014, 3210, 518, 279, 835, 3643, 432, 1196, 21896, 369, 4623, 16230, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 12730, 1731, 788, 341, 262, 330, 63593, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 53371, 788, 220, 17, 16, 24, 17, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 84315, 37, 11359, 788, 2278, 414, 330, 59604, 374, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 323, 702, 1012, 1181, 3946, 6722, 2474, 220, 16, 24, 24, 23, 10346, 414, 330, 2132, 374, 3881, 369, 1181, 9080, 3840, 11, 59924, 1075, 279, 468, 3092, 301, 21938, 11, 323, 1181, 10173, 304, 18560, 11, 17206, 11, 323, 11153, 10346, 414, 330, 59604, 374, 3545, 13862, 311, 438, 279, 364, 12730, 315, 8658, 2894, 364, 785, 4311, 315, 10689, 2894, 323, 364, 785, 3864, 100429, 315, 279, 4337, 3159, 698, 262, 5133, 220, 456, 532, 13874, 19324, 2610, 646, 990, 419, 4718, 821, 311, 3037, 1995, 911, 12095, 1667, 264, 41722, 20014, 9934, 11, 369, 3110, 1447, 73594, 46216, 198, 3, 41722, 20014, 330, 3838, 374, 279, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 47369, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '354d88a521ff45be9530588418bf340a', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 563, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.6583781242370605, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763173076.5364766}}</strong>"

The capital city is Paris, right? That's the main city there. I think I remember that Paris is a major city in France, known for its landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.\n",

I'm not certain. I should try to remember if I've heard any recent statistics. I think it's approximately 2,100,000 people. But I'm not 100% sure about that number.\n",
