    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

      "{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

First, I need to figure out what exactly they\\'re looking for. They probably want a structured data format for easy access, like a program or website.\\n\\nI know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s clear. Now, I should consider what data points they might need. Population is straightforward, but maybe they also want the approximate figure since exact numbers can change. Paris\\'s population is roughly around 2 million. But I should note that it can vary depending on the source and time.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information in JSON. I\\'ll start with the basic details: city name, country, and location within the country. Then, move on to population details, including current estimates and the year it\\'s from. Including landmarks related to the city could add value, listing well-known places which can help in providing more context.\\n\\nI also think about the user\\'s possible intentions. They might be developing an app, conducting research, or just need quick facts. By including landmarks, I can offer more depth, making the information richer. \\n\\nI\\'ll make sure the JSON is correctly formatted with proper syntax, using strings, numbers, and appropriate data types. It\\'s important to include all necessary fields without making it too cluttered. Keeping it concise but informative seems key.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the information clearly, ensuring that each field is labeled and easily understandable. That should fulfill the user\\'s request effectively.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly!
