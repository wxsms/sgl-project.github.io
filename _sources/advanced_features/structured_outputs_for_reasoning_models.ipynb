    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Alright, let's see. The user is in New York and wants the current date and time along with the weather. So, I need to figure out which functions to use and how to structure the request.<br><br>First, the user mentioned they're in New York, but the functions don't require the location for weather. They do, however, for the date and time. So, I'll need to use get_current_date for the date and time. The timezone parameter should be 'America/New_York' since that's where the user is.<br><br>Next, for the weather, the get_current_weather function is available. The required parameters are city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state would be 'NY' since New York is NY. The unit should be in Fahrenheit because the user didn't specify, but it's a common request, so Fahrenheit makes sense.<br><br>I should structure the message by first calling get_current_date with the timezone parameter. Then, in the same message, include the get_current_weather function with the necessary parameters. Each function call should be on its own line, but since the user is asking for both in one message, I can include both within the same line, separated by a comma or within the same JSON structure.<br><br>Wait, actually, looking at the function call format, each function should be on its own line. So, I might need to send two separate function calls in the response. But the user's example shows both functions in one message, so perhaps it's acceptable to include both within the same parameters.<br><br>Wait, no, the example shows a single function call with parameters. So, in this case, the user is asking for two separate pieces of information, so I need to make two separate function calls in the response. But the user's instructions say to reply in a specific format, so perhaps I can include both within the same message by separating them with a comma.<br><br>Alternatively, I can structure the response with each function call on a new line. But the user's example shows a single function call on one line. Hmm.<br><br>Wait, the user's example was a single function call, so perhaps I should structure each function call separately in the response, each on their own line, but within the same message. So, the first function call for the date and time, then a new line for the weather.<br><br>But the user's message was a single request, so I think it's acceptable to include both function calls within the same message, each on their own line, but within the same overall message. So, the response would have two function calls, each on their own line, but part of the same message.<br><br>Wait, but the user's example had a single function call on one line. So, perhaps I should structure each function call on a separate line within the same message. So, the first line is the date and time, the second line is the weather.<br><br>But the user's initial message was a single line, so I think the assistant can structure the response with each function call on a new line, but within the same message block.<br><br>So, putting it all together, the first function call is get_current_date with timezone 'America/New_York'. The second function call is get_current_weather with city 'New York', state 'NY', and unit 'fahrenheit'.<br><br>I should also remember to add the sources, but since the functions are predefined, there's no external data needed, so the sources can be omitted.<br><br>Wait, no, the functions are part of the assistant's capabilities, so perhaps no sources are needed beyond the function calls themselves.<br><br>So, the final response should be two function calls, each on their own line, within the same message. Each function call should follow the specified format, with the function name and parameters in JSON.<br><br>So, the first line would be <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>, and the second line would be <function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>.<br><br>Yes, that makes sense. Each function is called separately, each on its own line, within the same message. The parameters are correctly formatted as JSON objects within the function calls.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to find the capital of France. Hmm, where is France located? I think it\\'s in Europe, right? Let me confirm. Yes, France is in Western Europe, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Now, the capital... I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s Paris. But wait, I\\'m not 100% sure. Maybe it\\'s somewhere else? I recall that some countries have their capitals in different cities. Wait, no, I\\'m pretty confident that Paris is the capital of France.\\n\\nAlright, now that I have the capital figured out, I need the population. What\\'s the population of Paris? I remember it\\'s a major city, one of the largest in France. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not certain. Let me try to recall any previous knowledge or maybe think about how populations are usually reported. In many cities, the population might be rounded or given in a specific format. Oh, right, sometimes it\\'s rounded to the nearest thousand or something.\\n\\nI think in recent years, Paris has had a population around 2 million to 3 million. Wait, no, actually, maybe 3 million. I\\'m not entirely sure about the exact figure. Let me try to think of any recent statistics. In 2019, Paris had a population of about 2,195,000, I believe, but that\\'s assigned to the urban area, not the metropolitan area. The metropolitan area might be larger, but the city itself is around 2.19 million. So, perhaps rounding it to 2 million would be a good approximation.\\n\\nAlso, I should consider when the population figure is changing. Population can fluctuate due to births, deaths, and migration. So the exact number might be a bit off, but for general purposes, 2 million is a commonly cited figure. I don\\'t want to provide incorrect information, so I\\'ll stick with 2 million as the population of Paris, the capital of France.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check my memory. I think in some sources, Paris\\'s population is cited as over 3 million. Did I mix it up with another major city? Maybe not. Paris is said to be one of the most populous cities in France but not necessarily the most populous in the entire country. Wait, France\\'s total population is around 40 million, so individual cities can\\'t be over 3 million. But my initial thought was that Paris is around 2 million. Maybe the 3 million figure I thought of earlier was the metropolitan area? Hmm, I\\'m a bit confused now.\\n\\nTo clarify, the city proper of Paris, the Capital, is around 2 million, while the urban area, which includes built-up regions, is more than 3 million. But since the question is about the city which is the capital, I think it\\'s best to stick with the city proper population, which is approximately 2 million.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON format should have \"country\": \"France\", \"capital\": \"Paris\", and \"population\": 2000000.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2000000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 88190, 11, 1380, 374, 9625, 7407, 30, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 304, 4505, 11, 1290, 30, 6771, 752, 7683, 13, 7414, 11, 9625, 374, 304, 10867, 4505, 11, 1948, 279, 22375, 21575, 323, 279, 37685, 15029, 13, 4695, 11, 279, 6722, 1112, 358, 2776, 5020, 2704, 432, 594, 12095, 13, 1988, 3783, 11, 358, 2776, 537, 220, 16, 15, 15, 4, 2704, 13, 10696, 432, 594, 14696, 770, 30, 358, 19091, 429, 1045, 5837, 614, 862, 92999, 304, 2155, 9720, 13, 13824, 11, 902, 11, 358, 2776, 5020, 16506, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 382, 71486, 11, 1431, 429, 358, 614, 279, 6722, 24692, 700, 11, 358, 1184, 279, 7042, 13, 3555, 594, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 30, 358, 6099, 432, 594, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 825, 315, 279, 7772, 304, 9625, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 3654, 13, 6771, 752, 1430, 311, 19091, 894, 3681, 6540, 476, 7196, 1744, 911, 1246, 21910, 525, 5990, 4961, 13, 758, 1657, 9720, 11, 279, 7042, 2578, 387, 17976, 476, 2661, 304, 264, 3151, 3561, 13, 8670, 11, 1290, 11, 7025, 432, 594, 17976, 311, 279, 23480, 16183, 476, 2494, 382, 40, 1744, 304, 3213, 1635, 11, 12095, 702, 1030, 264, 7042, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 311, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 13824, 11, 902, 11, 3520, 11, 7196, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 2704, 911, 279, 4734, 7071, 13, 6771, 752, 1430, 311, 1744, 315, 894, 3213, 13142, 13, 758, 220, 17, 15, 16, 24, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 24, 20, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 358, 4411, 11, 714, 429, 594, 12607, 311, 279, 15662, 3082, 11, 537, 279, 57406, 3082, 13, 576, 57406, 3082, 2578, 387, 8131, 11, 714, 279, 3283, 5086, 374, 2163, 220, 17, 13, 16, 24, 3526, 13, 2055, 11, 8365, 51562, 432, 311, 220, 17, 3526, 1035, 387, 264, 1661, 56204, 382, 13394, 11, 358, 1265, 2908, 979, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 10018, 13, 39529, 646, 38288, 6292, 4152, 311, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 11906, 13, 2055, 279, 4734, 1372, 2578, 387, 264, 2699, 1007, 11, 714, 369, 4586, 9895, 11, 220, 17, 3526, 374, 264, 16626, 21870, 7071, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1366, 311, 3410, 15114, 1995, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 9214, 448, 220, 17, 3526, 438, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 11, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 382, 14190, 11, 1077, 752, 1990, 15934, 847, 4938, 13, 358, 1744, 304, 1045, 8173, 11, 12095, 594, 7042, 374, 21870, 438, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 14568, 358, 6514, 432, 705, 448, 2441, 3598, 3283, 30, 10696, 537, 13, 12095, 374, 1053, 311, 387, 825, 315, 279, 1429, 94451, 9720, 304, 9625, 714, 537, 14312, 279, 1429, 94451, 304, 279, 4453, 3146, 13, 13824, 11, 9625, 594, 2790, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 19, 15, 3526, 11, 773, 3842, 9720, 646, 944, 387, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 1988, 847, 2856, 3381, 572, 429, 12095, 374, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 13, 10696, 279, 220, 18, 3526, 7071, 358, 3381, 315, 6788, 572, 279, 57406, 3082, 30, 88190, 11, 358, 2776, 264, 2699, 21815, 1431, 382, 1249, 37163, 11, 279, 3283, 6169, 315, 12095, 11, 279, 18374, 11, 374, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 1393, 279, 15662, 3082, 11, 892, 5646, 5798, 5239, 13604, 11, 374, 803, 1091, 220, 18, 3526, 13, 1988, 2474, 279, 3405, 374, 911, 279, 3283, 892, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 1850, 311, 9214, 448, 279, 3283, 6169, 7042, 11, 892, 374, 13187, 220, 17, 3526, 382, 4416, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 3561, 1265, 614, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 497, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 323, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'c2a9e8166b3b4c9f91c95ad80315be6b', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 681, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.715978384017944, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1769769108.70537}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should determine the capital of France. From what I remember, Paris is the capital of France. That's pretty much a given, right? So the key here would be \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need the population. Population figures can change over time, so I should check a reliable source. I think as of the latest estimates, Paris has a population around 2 million. But I should make sure that's up-to-date. Maybe around 2023, the population is approximately 2,158,000. I should include that as the \"population\" field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user specifically asked for JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to represent data structures in a readable format. So I need to structure this into a JSON object. The format would be like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2158000}. That should be straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I include any units? The user just asked for population, so I think just the number without units is fine. But maybe adding 'approximate' to indicate it's an estimate could be helpful, just in case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON object would have two key-value pairs: one for the capital and one for the population. I should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. No trailing commas or anything, as that can cause errors in JSON parsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the user needs more details beyond just the capital and population. They might be looking for geographical info, economic stats, or something else about Paris. But since they specifically asked for population, I'll stick to that unless they follow up with another query.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, considering the user might be using this information for a project or a presentation, providing accurate and recent data is important. Maybe mentioning that the population figure is subject to change due to ongoing demographic trends would be good, so they know it's an approximation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, my response should be a simple JSON object with the capital as \"Paris\" and the population as approximately 2,158,000. I'll present it clearly and concisely to meet the user's needs.\n",
