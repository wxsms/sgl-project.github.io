    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the current date and time in New York and the weather there using the given functions. Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I know I need two pieces of information: the date and time in New York and the weather in New York. The functions available are 'get_current_weather' and 'get_current_date'. <br><br>Starting with the date and time. The function 'get_current_date' requires a timezone parameter. Since the user is in New York, I should use the timezone 'America/New_York'. I'll structure the function call as <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>. That should give me the current date and time in New York.<br><br>Next, for the weather. The function 'get_current_weather' needs a city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and I should get the temperature in Fahrenheit since that's a common unit people use. So the parameters would be city: 'New York', state: 'NY', unit: 'fahrenheit'. The function call would be <function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function>.<br><br>I should make sure to call these functions one after the other. First, the date and time, then the weather. Each function call needs to be on its own line with the correct parameters. I also need to remember to include the sources where I got the information from, but since the functions are provided, I don't need external data, so I'll just mention that I used the given functions as sources.<br><br>Wait, do I need to combine both results into one message? The user asked for both, so perhaps I should present them together. But the instructions say to use the functions and reply in the specified format, so each function call should be separate. I think it's better to have two separate function calls, one for date/time and one for weather, each with their parameters.<br><br>So, putting it all together, I'll write the two function calls one after the other, each properly formatted with their respective parameters. That should cover both the date and weather information the user is asking for.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I just received a query asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me try to break this down. First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That\\'s pretty straightforward.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON is a data interchange format that\\'s structured with key-value pairs, which is great for organizing information neatly. I should probably structure it with keys like \"city,\" \"country,\" \"population,\" and maybe some other related details like the date it was elected as the capital or its timezone.\\n\\nWait, I\\'m not sure if the user is expecting anything beyond the population. They didn\\'t specify, but providing a few additional facts might make it more informative. For example, Paris is known as the \"City of Light,\" so I can include that. Also, Paris Time is a thing, so maybe adding the timezone and daylight saving time information would be helpful.\\n\\nI should check the current population of Paris to make sure it\\'s accurate. Population figures can change every year, so I should look up the most recent data. Let me see, as of 2023, Paris has a population of around 3,500,000. I think that\\'s correct, but I should verify it to be sure.\\n\\nAlso, the user might be interested in knowing that Paris is the most populated city in France. Including that could add value to the response. I\\'ll structure it so that each key corresponds to the relevant information, keeping it clear and concise.\\n\\nI wonder if the user is building a tool or app where they need this data. If so, having accurate and structured information is crucial. They might also appreciate some cultural facts about Paris, like its historical significance, to give a more rounded answer.\\n\\nLet me make sure all the keys I\\'m including are relevant and not too broad. \"city\" is essential, \"country\" to show its location, \"population\" and \"year\" for up-to-date info, \"facts\" for additional details, and \"time\" for practical timezone information. That should cover the bases.\\n\\nI should double-check where the population number came from. Maybe the France section of Wikipedia or a reliable demographic source. Also, confirming that Paris is indeed the capital and that the timezone is accurate is important to avoid any mistakes.\\n\\nOverall, the user probably wants a well-structured JSON response that\\'s easy to read and contains all the necessary details without being overwhelming. Making sure it\\'s both accurate and helpful is key here. I think including the population along with a year will make it clear, and adding a few fun facts about Paris can make the information more interesting.\\n</think>\\n\\nCertainly! Here is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"country\": \"France\",\\n  \"population\": \"3,500,000\",\\n  \"year\": \"2023\",\\n  \"facts\": {\\n    \"description\": \"The City of Light, known for its historical landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and the Chairman of the Board\\'s Office.\",\\n    \"timezone\": \"UTC+1\",\\n    \"dst\": \"UTC+2 in夏秋时\",\\n    \"history\": \"Parigi has been a capital of France since 1589.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet me know if you need further details or adjustments!', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 358, 1101, 3949, 264, 3239, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1430, 311, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1414, 429, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 13, 2938, 594, 5020, 30339, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 1196, 6801, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 374, 264, 821, 51263, 3561, 429, 594, 32930, 448, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 892, 374, 2244, 369, 34721, 1995, 62166, 13, 358, 1265, 4658, 5944, 432, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 1335, 330, 11141, 1335, 330, 44441, 1335, 323, 7196, 1045, 1008, 5435, 3565, 1075, 279, 2400, 432, 572, 16290, 438, 279, 6722, 476, 1181, 33957, 382, 14190, 11, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 421, 279, 1196, 374, 22331, 4113, 7797, 279, 7042, 13, 2379, 3207, 944, 13837, 11, 714, 8241, 264, 2421, 5107, 13064, 2578, 1281, 432, 803, 38219, 13, 1752, 3110, 11, 12095, 374, 3881, 438, 279, 330, 12730, 315, 8658, 1335, 773, 358, 646, 2924, 429, 13, 7281, 11, 12095, 4120, 374, 264, 3166, 11, 773, 7196, 7842, 279, 33957, 323, 52021, 13997, 882, 1995, 1035, 387, 10950, 382, 40, 1265, 1779, 279, 1482, 7042, 315, 12095, 311, 1281, 2704, 432, 594, 13382, 13, 39529, 12396, 646, 2297, 1449, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1401, 705, 279, 1429, 3213, 821, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 12095, 702, 264, 7042, 315, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 358, 1744, 429, 594, 4396, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 432, 311, 387, 2704, 382, 13394, 11, 279, 1196, 2578, 387, 8014, 304, 14063, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 1429, 34359, 3283, 304, 9625, 13, 55121, 429, 1410, 912, 897, 311, 279, 2033, 13, 358, 3278, 5944, 432, 773, 429, 1817, 1376, 33210, 311, 279, 9760, 1995, 11, 10282, 432, 2797, 323, 63594, 382, 40, 5775, 421, 279, 1196, 374, 4752, 264, 5392, 476, 906, 1380, 807, 1184, 419, 821, 13, 1416, 773, 11, 3432, 13382, 323, 32930, 1995, 374, 16587, 13, 2379, 2578, 1083, 15401, 1045, 12752, 13064, 911, 12095, 11, 1075, 1181, 13656, 25361, 11, 311, 2968, 264, 803, 17976, 4226, 382, 10061, 752, 1281, 2704, 678, 279, 6894, 358, 2776, 2670, 525, 9760, 323, 537, 2238, 7205, 13, 330, 8926, 1, 374, 7565, 11, 330, 11141, 1, 311, 1473, 1181, 3728, 11, 330, 44441, 1, 323, 330, 3157, 1, 369, 705, 4686, 18413, 3546, 11, 330, 68053, 1, 369, 5107, 3565, 11, 323, 330, 1678, 1, 369, 14976, 33957, 1995, 13, 2938, 1265, 3421, 279, 23092, 382, 40, 1265, 1990, 15934, 1380, 279, 7042, 1372, 3697, 504, 13, 10696, 279, 9625, 3772, 315, 26587, 476, 264, 14720, 37362, 2530, 13, 7281, 11, 48996, 429, 12095, 374, 12824, 279, 6722, 323, 429, 279, 33957, 374, 13382, 374, 2989, 311, 5648, 894, 20643, 382, 27489, 11, 279, 1196, 4658, 6801, 264, 1632, 12, 51143, 4718, 2033, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 323, 5610, 678, 279, 5871, 3565, 2041, 1660, 22024, 13, 24288, 2704, 432, 594, 2176, 13382, 323, 10950, 374, 1376, 1588, 13, 358, 1744, 2670, 279, 7042, 3156, 448, 264, 1042, 686, 1281, 432, 2797, 11, 323, 7842, 264, 2421, 2464, 13064, 911, 12095, 646, 1281, 279, 1995, 803, 7040, 624, 151649, 271, 95456, 0, 5692, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 330, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 756, 220, 330, 3157, 788, 330, 17, 15, 17, 18, 756, 220, 330, 68053, 788, 341, 262, 330, 4684, 788, 330, 785, 4311, 315, 8658, 11, 3881, 369, 1181, 13656, 59924, 1741, 438, 279, 468, 3092, 301, 21938, 11, 279, 9729, 48506, 16328, 11, 323, 279, 26294, 315, 279, 8751, 594, 8246, 10346, 262, 330, 43271, 788, 330, 21183, 10, 16, 756, 262, 330, 15658, 788, 330, 21183, 10, 17, 304, 100039, 100057, 13343, 756, 262, 330, 18844, 788, 330, 4272, 29537, 702, 1012, 264, 6722, 315, 9625, 2474, 220, 16, 20, 23, 24, 10040, 220, 456, 532, 13874, 19324, 10061, 752, 1414, 421, 498, 1184, 4623, 3565, 476, 32974, 0, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '7ec0c444784245cbbcede0dc35462bb7', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 707, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'cached_tokens_details': None, 'e2e_latency': 4.387662649154663, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1771342424.8037252}}</strong>"

I'll need to look up the latest population data to ensure accuracy. From what I recall, the population is over 3 million, but I should verify that.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'll start by identifying the keys. The main ones would be \"city\" which is \"Paris\", \"country\" which is \"France\", and \"population\". For the population, I'll include the approximate figure, perhaps with a note about it being an estimate for the most recent data. Also, adding a \"description\" could be helpful to provide some context, like mentioning that Paris is known for its cultural significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure that the JSON structure is valid. Each key should be in quotes, and the values appropriately formatted. The entire data should be enclosed in curly braces, and keys separated by commas. I'll double-check the syntax to avoid any errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I'll consider if the user needs more details. They might be a student, researcher, or someone planning a trip. Since they specifically asked for the capital's population, I'll stick to that but offer to provide more information if needed. That way, I'm being considerate of their potential deeper needs.\n",
