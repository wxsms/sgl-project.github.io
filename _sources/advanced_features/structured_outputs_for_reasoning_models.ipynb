    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down step by step.<br><br>First, I need to figure out how to get the current date and time for New York's timezone. The user mentioned they're in New York, so I should use the 'get_current_date' function. The function requires a timezone parameter, which in this case is 'America/New_York'. <br><br>Next, for the weather, since the user is in New York, I should use the 'get_current_weather' function. This function needs a city and state. New York's state abbreviation is NY, so the city would be 'New York' and the state would be 'NY'.<br><br>I should structure the message to first ask for the date and time using the function call for get_current_date with the timezone parameter. Then, immediately after, ask for the weather using get_current_weather with the city and state parameters. This way, the user gets both pieces of information in one go, but I have to make sure each function call is separate as per the instructions.<br><br>Wait, the user's message was a single request, so I need to combine both function calls into one message. But according to the instructions, I can only call one function at a time. So I should probably send both function calls in separate messages, but since the user is asking for both in one go, I need to structure it correctly.<br><br>Hmm, maybe I should combine them into a single message, but since each function call is separate, I'll have to send them one after the other. Alternatively, I can ask for both in one go, but the functions are separate. I think the best approach is to send each function call in its own line, ensuring clarity.<br><br>So, I'll first send the date and time using get_current_date with the timezone parameter. Then, in the next message, I'll send the weather using get_current_weather with city and state. But since the user might want both in one message, I should structure it in a way that it's clear which function is which.<br><br>Wait, the user's initial message was asking for both, so perhaps I should include both function calls in the same message. Let me check the instructions again. It says if I choose to call a function, reply in the specified format. So I can include both function calls in the same message, each on their own line, but separated by a space or something.<br><br>Alternatively, maybe I can combine them into a single function call, but the functions are separate. So perhaps I should send two separate function calls, each in their own line, but within the same message. Let me see how that would look.<br><br>Wait, the user's example showed a single function call. So perhaps I should structure it as two separate function calls, each on their own line, but within the same message. That way, the user can see both results.<br><br>But I need to make sure that each function call is correctly formatted with the start_tag, the function name, and the parameters in JSON format. So for the date, it would be:<br><br><function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}<br><br>And for the weather:<br><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\"}<br><br>I think that's correct. I should make sure to include both function calls in the same message, each on their own line, to provide both pieces of information clearly. That way, the user gets the current date and time, and then the current weather in New York.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function><br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\"      \t\t, \"unit\": \"celsius\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user has just asked me to provide information and the population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, okay. Let\\'s break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand exactly what they\\'re asking for. The capital of France is Paris, so I know that\\'s the key piece of information here. They want data about Paris, specifically its population, and they want it in JSON format. That specifies the structure, so that\\'s helpful.\\n\\nWait, should I just give them the current population of Paris? I remember that population figures can change over time, depending on births, deaths, and migration. But Paris is a major city, and it\\'s also a administrative center, so maybe they just want a recent estimate. I should make sure to get the most accurate and up-to-date number.\\n\\nDo I have that number on hand? I think the population is around 2.2 million as of the latest estimates. Let me double-check to be sure. Yes, I\\'m pretty confident about that figure.\\n\\nNow, what information should I include in the JSON. The user mentioned \"information,\" so I should consider key facts about the city. Maybe its location, some interesting tidbits about its history or culture, and notable landmarks. That makes the JSON more informative and useful.\\n\\nI\\'ll start with the city name and population. I should organize these into an object structure. Maybe separate the basic info from the additional details. So, under \"city,\" I can have \"name\" and \"population.\" Then, under \"facts,\" I can include age distribution, elevation, history, notable landmarks, and culture. That should cover a comprehensive overview.\\n\\nWait, should I explain each point simply? Probably, since it\\'s data meant to be easily understood. For example, the population pyramid showing the age composition. That\\'s a good way to present demographical data without getting too technical.\\n\\nI should also make sure the JSON is well-formatted. Indentation and brackets in the right places so it\\'s valid. No syntax errors, or else the system might not process it correctly. Also, proper escaping for any special characters, but since this is straightforward, I think it\\'s manageable.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider: the cultural significance of Paris is immense. Including points about its role in arts, literature, and history could add value to the response. Maybe mention how it\\'s often called the \"City of Light\" with its famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. Also, the arts vibrations and status as a global city are important aspects.\\n\\nI wonder if the user is writing an article, a report, or perhaps a homework assignment. If it\\'s a general question, providing detailed yet concise information would be best. They probably want a structured and easy-to-reference JSON without too much fluff, but including enough detail to be informative.\\n\\nOh, and the elevation of Paris is about 36 meters, or 120 feet above sea level. That\\'s a nice fact to include, especially for those who might be interested in geographical context. Also, the population pyramid helps users visualize the age distribution, which can be useful for demographic analysis.\\n\\nShould I mention anything about Paris\\'s climate? Well, it\\'s a UNESCO city and has a mix of old and modern architecture, which is part of its charm but maybe beyond the scope unless the user specifically asks. Since they didn\\'t mention it, I\\'ll stick to the main points.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with a \"city\" object that includes \"name\" and \"population,\" followed by a \"facts\" object containing all the additional information. I\\'ll make sure the numbers are accurate and the explanations are clear. Once done, I\\'ll present it neatly, so it\\'s easy to copy and use if needed.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s a need for sources or references. The user didn\\'t specify, so I\\'ll assume they just need the information as it is without further details. So, including the latest data is crucial.\\n\\nAlright, I think that covers the main points. I\\'ll draft the JSON accordingly, ensuring it\\'s correct and comprehensive. Double-checking the numbers and structure before finalizing the response.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2175000  // As of the latest estimate\\n  },\\n  \"facts\": {\\n    \"age_distribution\": \"Population pyramid showing Paris\\'s demographic
