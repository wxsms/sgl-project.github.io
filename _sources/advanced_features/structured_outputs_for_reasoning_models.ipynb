    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out which city is the capital of France. That\\'s easy, it\\'s Paris. Okay, so the capital is definitely Paris.\\n\\nNext, I need the population. Population data can change over time, so I should look up the most recent figure. I remember that as of recent years, Paris has been growing, but not as fast as other major cities. Let me check a reliable source or maybe the last census data.\\n\\nWait, I think the population in Paris is around 2 million people. But to be accurate, I should verify. Let me recall that the population figure was approximately 2,150,000 in 2020. Yeah, that sounds about right. It might be a bit higher now, maybe around 2,200,000, but for a general response, 2.15 million should suffice.\\n\\nNow, the user wants the information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, so I need to structure it properly with key-value pairs. The main keys I should include are \"city\" and \"population\". Maybe also add a \"description\" field to provide some context about the city, like its nickname or significance.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON should have a \"data\" object containing these fields. It should look neat and be properly formatted to ensure there are commas and brackets in the right places. Let me structure it like this: { \"data\": { \"city\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2150000, \"description\": \"The capital city of France, known for its historical landmarks and cultural significance.\" } }\\n\\nI should double-check the numbers to make sure there\\'s no mistake. Population can fluctuate due to various factors, so it\\'s better to use the most recent and accurate data available. Maybe I can think of the current estimate, but since I don\\'t have real-time data, sticking with the 2020 figure is the way to go for this response.\\n\\nAlso, considering the user might need this data for something, perhaps a report or a presentation, it\\'s important that the JSON is well-formatted without any syntax errors. Brackets and commas should be in place to ensure the data can be easily parsed by any application that reads JSON.\\n\\nMaybe I should also include units for the population, like specifying \"2.15 million\" instead of just the number for clarity, but looking back at my response, I used the number. Alternatively, I could include both, but that might complicate things. Since the user didn\\'t specify, I\\'ll keep it simple with just the number and the unit in the description.\\n\\nIn summary, the JSON should clearly state that the capital is Paris with a population of approximately 2.15 million, and a brief description about its significance. I think that covers everything the user asked for and provides a useful and accurate piece of information in the requested format.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"data\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 2150000,\\n    \"description\": \"The capital city of France, known for its historical landmarks and cultural significance.\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 1077, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 892, 3283, 374, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 2938, 594, 4135, 11, 432, 594, 12095, 13, 35439, 11, 773, 279, 6722, 374, 8491, 12095, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 279, 7042, 13, 39529, 821, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1401, 705, 279, 1429, 3213, 7071, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 438, 315, 3213, 1635, 11, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 537, 438, 4937, 438, 1008, 3598, 9720, 13, 6771, 752, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 476, 7196, 279, 1537, 43602, 821, 382, 14190, 11, 358, 1744, 279, 7042, 304, 12095, 374, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 1251, 13, 1988, 311, 387, 13382, 11, 358, 1265, 10146, 13, 6771, 752, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 572, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 20, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 304, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 13, 21607, 11, 429, 10362, 911, 1290, 13, 1084, 2578, 387, 264, 2699, 5080, 1431, 11, 7196, 2163, 220, 17, 11, 17, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 714, 369, 264, 4586, 2033, 11, 220, 17, 13, 16, 20, 3526, 1265, 76156, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 1196, 6801, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 13352, 369, 12914, 3002, 2806, 367, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 432, 10277, 448, 1376, 19083, 13530, 13, 576, 1887, 6894, 358, 1265, 2924, 525, 330, 8926, 1, 323, 330, 44441, 3263, 10696, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 4684, 1, 2070, 311, 3410, 1045, 2266, 911, 279, 3283, 11, 1075, 1181, 29399, 476, 25361, 382, 4416, 11, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 614, 264, 330, 691, 1, 1633, 8482, 1493, 5043, 13, 1084, 1265, 1401, 28485, 323, 387, 10277, 23126, 311, 5978, 1052, 525, 76602, 323, 38929, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 6771, 752, 5944, 432, 1075, 419, 25, 314, 330, 691, 788, 314, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 497, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 11, 330, 4684, 788, 330, 785, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 11, 3881, 369, 1181, 13656, 59924, 323, 12752, 25361, 1189, 335, 555, 40, 1265, 1990, 15934, 279, 5109, 311, 1281, 2704, 1052, 594, 902, 16523, 13, 39529, 646, 38288, 6292, 4152, 311, 5257, 9363, 11, 773, 432, 594, 2664, 311, 990, 279, 1429, 3213, 323, 13382, 821, 2500, 13, 10696, 358, 646, 1744, 315, 279, 1482, 16045, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 1513, 944, 614, 1931, 7246, 821, 11, 36972, 448, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 7071, 374, 279, 1616, 311, 728, 369, 419, 2033, 382, 13394, 11, 12831, 279, 1196, 2578, 1184, 419, 821, 369, 2494, 11, 8365, 264, 1895, 476, 264, 15496, 11, 432, 594, 2989, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 1632, 8460, 12127, 2041, 894, 19482, 5975, 13, 3240, 18382, 323, 76602, 1265, 387, 304, 1992, 311, 5978, 279, 821, 646, 387, 6707, 15676, 553, 894, 3766, 429, 15804, 4718, 382, 21390, 358, 1265, 1083, 2924, 8153, 369, 279, 7042, 11, 1075, 37838, 330, 17, 13, 16, 20, 3526, 1, 4518, 315, 1101, 279, 1372, 369, 31273, 11, 714, 3330, 1182, 518, 847, 2033, 11, 358, 1483, 279, 1372, 13, 38478, 11, 358, 1410, 2924, 2176, 11, 714, 429, 2578, 1367, 48795, 2513, 13, 8704, 279, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 11, 358, 3278, 2506, 432, 4285, 448, 1101, 279, 1372, 323, 279, 4982, 304, 279, 4008, 382, 641, 12126, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 9355, 1584, 429, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 448, 264, 7042, 315, 13187, 220, 17, 13, 16, 20, 3526, 11, 323, 264, 9814, 4008, 911, 1181, 25361, 13, 358, 1744, 429, 14521, 4297, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 323, 5707, 264, 5390, 323, 13382, 6573, 315, 1995, 304, 279, 11223, 3561, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 691, 788, 341, 262, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 262, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 262, 330, 4684, 788, 330, 785, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 11, 3881, 369, 1181, 13656, 59924, 323, 12752, 25361, 10040, 220, 456, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '3c13a2bd8fee49859de7cf5d5c235b54', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 689, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'cached_tokens_details': None, 'e2e_latency': 4.834678411483765, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1770709739.4097438}}</strong>"

      "Generated text: Alright, so I need to figure out the information and population of the capital of France. Okay, first, I know that the capital of France is Paris. Got that down. Now, I should probably look up the current population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city, so it must have a sizable population, but I'm not exactly sure how many.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've heard somewhere that Paris has over 3 million people. Let me check a reliable source. Maybe the official government website or a reputable news article. Wait, I can't access the internet right now, so I'll have to go with my memory. I'm pretty sure the population is around 3.5 million, maybe a bit higher now because of the population growth over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about other cities in France to compare. For example, Lyon is another big city, but it's not the capital. Its population is less than Paris's, maybe around 1.1 million. So, Paris is definitely the most populous city in France.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, about the information format. The user asked for JSON format, so I need to structure the data accordingly. I'll create an object with a key for \"capital\" and another for \"population\". Under \"population\", I should include both the approximate number and maybe the exact figure if I can recall it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, do I know the exact population? I think it's something like 3,500,000, but I'm not 100% certain. It might have changed a bit over the years. Maybe I should just state it as approximately 3.5 million to be safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a main object with \"capital\" as \"Paris\" and \"population\" as the number. I'll write it out clearly, making sure the syntax is correct with commas and colons in the right places.\n",
