    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I need to figure out how to get this information using the functions provided. <br><br>First, I should use the get_current_date function because it's meant for getting the current date and time in a specific timezone. The user mentioned New York, so I'll set the timezone parameter to 'America/New_York'. That should give me the correct date and time.<br><br>Next, for the weather, I'll use the get_current_weather function. The city is New York, and since it's in the US, the state abbreviation is NY. I'll set the unit to Fahrenheit because the user didn't specify, but it's a common request. <br><br>I need to make sure I structure the function calls correctly. Each function should be called separately, and I'll include the parameters in the correct JSON format. Also, I should remember to add the sources where I got the functions from, which in this case are the provided documentation.<br><br>Wait, the user mentioned putting the entire function call on one line. So I need to format each function call without any extra lines. I'll make sure to use the correct syntax for JSON and the function calls.<br><br>Let me double-check the parameters. For get_current_date, only timezone is needed. For get_current_weather, city, state, and unit are required. I've included all of them correctly.<br><br>I think that's all. I'll format the response with each function call on separate lines, but since the user said to put the entire thing on one line, maybe I should combine them. Hmm, but each function is separate, so perhaps I should list them one after the other without line breaks. I'll check the example given earlier to see how it's done. In the example, each function is on a new line, but the user's example had a single line. Maybe I can structure it as two separate function calls on one line, separated by a comma or something. Wait, no, the user said to put the entire function call on one line, but each function is a separate function. So perhaps I should list them one after the other without line breaks, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe I can format it as a single line with both function calls, but that might not be clear. <br><br>I think the best approach is to list each function call on its own line within the same message, as the example showed. So I'll structure it with each function call on a new line, properly formatted with the start and end tags as specified.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}</function></strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

Maybe I should double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn't specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. <br><br>Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. <br><br>I should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I'll format this into a JSON object. <br><br>I also need to present this in a way that's easy to read, so I'll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. <br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I'll make sure to test it to ensure it's valid, but since I'm just writing it out, I'll assume it's correct based on my knowledge. <br><br>I think that's all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>\"name\": \"Paris\",<br>\"population\": 3500000}</strong>"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it.

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I have this request from the user asking for the information and population of the capital of France. Let me break it down. First, I need to figure out who the user is and what they need exactly. The user is asking for a JSON format response, so they probably want a structured data output, which is common for automated systems or APIs.\\n\\nHmm, the capital of France is Paris, that\\'s clear. Now, I need to gather the necessary information about Paris. The key points would be the administrative region where it\\'s located, the population, and the area in both square kilometers and square miles. I should also include the elevation because that\\'s a relevant piece of geographical data.\\n\\nPopulation estimates can change, so I should make sure to use the most recent data available. As of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, Paris\\' population was around 2,193,500. I should double-check that to ensure accuracy. Also, I\\'ll need to present the area with both metric and imperial units since the user didn\\'t specify a particular format beyond JSON.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the JSON with natural keys like \"AdministrativeRegion,\" \"Population,\" and \"SurfaceArea.\" I\\'ll include the region as \"Greater Paris,\" since that\\'s the broader administrative area encompassing Paris and its suburbs. For the population, I\\'ll mention the official estimate, specifying that it\\'s an approximate figure. The surface area should be broken down into both square kilometers and square miles for clarity.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and brackets.
