    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '30bab6de53774c19ac4abe7a86b7872e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.357940435409546, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766547122.9297907}}</strong>"

I need to provide this in JSON format. \\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll start by recalling some basic facts about Paris. I know it\\'s a major city in France, so I\\'ll mention that. Then, I should think about the population. I\\'m pretty sure Paris is the largest city in France, but I\\'m not certain about the exact population number. I\\'ll need to check that. \\n\\nI remember seeing somewhere that Paris has a population around 2 million, but I should verify if that\\'s up to date. Maybe it\\'s slightly higher now. Let me think... I think it\\'s about 2.17 million as of 2023. \\n\\nNext, I should consider adding facts to make the answer more informative. Maybe historical aspects, like when Paris was founded. I think it was founded around 750 BCE by the Parisii tribe. \\n\\nAlso, Paris is known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. Including this adds context and makes the information richer. \\n\\nTransportation might be another good point. Paris has the iconic Eiffel Tower, the Seine River, and major transportation systems like metro and RATP. \\n\\nI should structure the JSON with an \"info\" array containing the facts and a \"population\" object. The population should include total, metro area, and city limits. \\n\\nI need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted so there are no syntax errors. Also, the population numbers should be accurate and up-to-date. \\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll create a JSON structure with the key facts and the population data.

They mentioned \"population,\" so they probably want the current number of people living there. I should check the latest data, but since I can't access real-time info, I'll have to use the most recent estimate available. \n",
      "\n",
      "The capital of France is Paris, so I'll focus on that. Now, what other information do they need? Maybe the administrative region, like the department or arrondissement, and the area in square kilometers. Including the population density would also be helpful for context. \n",

      "I should structure this into a JSON format. The user likely wants a clear and concise response, so I'll make an object with the necessary fields. Let me list out the key points: city name, department, area, population, population density, and maybe a location link for more details. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure the numbers are up to date. I remember that Paris's population has been growing, so maybe around 2 million people. The area is definitely about 105 square kilometers, and the density would be population divided by area, so roughly 19,000 per km². \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll create a JSON object with these facts. I should also add a comment to clarify that the population is an estimate as of 2023. That way, the user knows it's approximate and not the exact current number. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the user is a student working on a project or maybe a researcher compiling data. They might need this information for a presentation or a report, so accuracy is important. Since I can't provide real-time data, giving a recent estimate should suffice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, including the location link could be helpful if they want to verify the data or get more detailed information. I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted so it's easy to read and use. \n",
