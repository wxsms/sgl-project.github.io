    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '243c3272ca6e43a0b56cb726d41bdd9f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3565173149108887, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764557536.8501165}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, let\\'s see. The user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, first, I need to figure out where the capital of FR is. I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s Paris, right? Yeah, Paris is definitely the capital.\\n\\nOkay, so the next step is to get accurate information about the current population. Population statistics can change over time, so I should check the most recent data available. I remember reading that populations are estimates, especially for places as large as France. As of 2021, I think there was a recent official count around 11 million, but I\\'m not 100% certain. Maybe I should verify this information from a reliable source like the Office National de la统计 (ONState) since it\\'s the French government\\'s official stats agency.\\n\\nWait, but the user didn\\'t specify a year, so I should probably provide the most recent figure. I might also want to include that population figures can fluctuate for context. Plus, I should think about the necessary fields for a JSON structure. Population is key here, so that needs to be the main field. But I should also probably include another field like \\'city\\' to specify it\\'s the capital. Alternatively, maybe a \\'name\\' field to label it as the capital. Hmm, JSON format requires key-value pairs, so either approach works.\\n\\nAlso, is there any other information they might need? The user just asked for information and population, so maybe just the population is sufficient. But in the example response, I included both the population and the city name. I think that\\'s helpful because it makes it clear which population figure is referring to the capital.\\n\\nI wonder if the user is aware that population numbers can vary depending on the source and the time of measurement. Since it\\'s JSON, it\\'s static, so I shouldn\\'t include that uncertainty in the response. Maybe it\\'s better to present the most accurate and commonly accepted figure, like what was the permanent population count after the 2020 census. I believe that number was around 10.5 million. Wait, no, after 2020, it might have been adjusted to 10.4-10.5 million, but I\\'m a bit fuzzy on the exact number. I should double-check that.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can just stick with a reliable source. ONState usually has updated data, so if I can get the latest figure from there, that would be the most accurate. But without accessing the current data, I\\'ll just proceed with the info I have. I\\'ll mention that the population is a rough estimate and could vary, but in this case, I\\'ll go with the 2019 figure of approximately 11 million as a general estimate.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure should have a keys \\'capital\\' or \\'city\\' and the value would be an object containing the population. So in JSON, it would look like:\\n\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": 11000000\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nWait, but maybe it\\'s better to structure it as a key \\'population\\' with the city as a property. So that it\\'s:\\n\\n{\\n  \"population\": {\\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"value\": 11000000\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nHmm, both structures are acceptable, but the first one with \\'capital\\' as a key holds more context. Anyway, I\\'ll proceed with the example given earlier, using the keys \\'capital\\' with \\'city\\' and \\'population\\'.\\n\\nI should also mention that my answer is based on the 2020 French census, so the user knows the figure is up to date as of that year. But since the user didn\\'t specify a year, it\\'s important to note that it\\'s the latest available, which is 2021 as of my last update, but perhaps I\\'m getting that wrong. To be precise, I should state it\\'s from the 2020 census.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"population\": \"11,000,000\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```',
