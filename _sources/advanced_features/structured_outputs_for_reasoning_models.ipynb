    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '2d4c891b73e046e5bcd2c10f6fef2846', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 4.730043172836304, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764192563.0109756}}</strong>"

Hmm, so first, I should confirm where the capital of France is. Let me think, Paris is definitely the capital. \\n\\nOkay, now I need to provide the population. I remember hearing that Paris has a large population, but I\\'m not entirely sure of the exact number. I should check the latest data to ensure accuracy. I\\'ll recall that in recent years, the population has been around 3.5 million, but it\\'s always growing. I should make sure it\\'s up to date.\\n\\nThe user requested this in JSON format, so I\\'ll structure it with a key for the capital city and another for the population. That makes it easy to read and perhaps use programmatically if they plan to use it elsewhere. \\n\\nI don\\'t think the user needs other details beyond the capital and population. They might be a student working on a project, or maybe someone planning a visit and wants a quick reference. Either way, providing a straightforward and accurate answer in the correct format should be sufficient. \\n\\nI should also consider if the population figure is precise or an estimate. Paris is a major city, so its population is significant but varies over time due to births, deaths, and migration. I\\'ll state it as an approximate figure, maybe mentioning that the exact number might change slightly depending on the source. \\n\\nAlright, time to put it all together.

      "Generated text: Okay, so I just received a query where the user is asking for the information and population of France's capital in JSON format. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward. But the user also wants the population, which I should present in JSON. Now, population numbers can change over time, so I need to make sure I provide the most current data available. I recall that as of recent estimates, Paris has around 2.1 million people. However, I should check if that number has changed recently, maybe due to new censuses or accurate records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user specified the population, so I should structure the JSON with both the capital's name and its population. It's important to present this information clearly and concisely. Maybe they're using this data for a project, a school assignment, or perhaps they're developing an app that requires this information. Either way, accuracy is key.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's any additional information that might be useful. For example, maybe including the area of Paris or some key landmarks. But the user specifically asked for the population, so I'll stick to that. However, providing a bit more context about the capital could be helpful if they're not just looking for numbers but also want some background.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure the JSON format is correct. The keys should be \"capital\" and \"population\", with corresponding values. I'll structure it like this: {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 2133000}. But wait, I should verify the exact number. Let me think, I believe the latest estimate is about 2,130,000 as of 2023. So I'll update the population figure accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should think about the formatting. The user might be using this data for a presentation or a website, so it's good to have it in a readable JSON format. Maybe they can easily parse it into a program or use it in a database. I should ensure there are no typos to maintain data integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thought: sometimes populations can be approximate, especially in rapidly changing cities like Paris where there might be ongoing development or migration. It's good practice to mention that the number is an estimate based on recent data. But since the user didn't ask for a detailed breakdown, I'll keep it simple and just provide the figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also check if there are any alternative names or official designations for the capital. But I think Paris is universally recognized as the capital, so that shouldn't be an issue. If the user is into geography or history, they might appreciate a bit more context, but again, the query was specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the user wants the JSON with the capital and its population. I'll provide accurate data, ensure the format is correct, and keep it concise. If they need more details later, they can ask for additional information. That should cover their needs.\n",
