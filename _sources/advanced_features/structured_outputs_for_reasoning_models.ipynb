    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

I think the population has been increasing over the years, so perhaps it's now over 3.5 million? I'm a bit confused because sometimes I hear different numbers, so I should make sure. Maybe I can recall that Paris has a metropolitan area that's much larger, but the city proper is around 3.5 million. I think I'll go with that for now.<br><br><br>content: Paris is the capital of France</strong>"

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the \"City of Light.\" People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>"

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

Hmm, I know the capital of France is Paris, that\\'s a given. But I should make sure it\\'s accurate. Let me think, Paris is the largest city in France, right? Yeah, that\\'s correct.\\n\\nNow, the population part. I remember from my studies that Paris is a very populous city, but the exact number is important. I think around 20-something million, maybe 20.5? I should cross-check that. Oh wait, because sometimes regions change, so I should ensure the population figure is the latest available.\\n\\nI want to provide the most up-to-date information, so perhaps I should look for the current population numbers. I think as of 2023, Paris\\'s population is approximately 20.562 million. That seems familiar. I\\'ll use that.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure should include the key \"city\" with the value \"Paris,\" and another key \"population\" with the number. It\\'s better to present two separate entries for clarity. Let me format that correctly without any markdown, just plain JSON since the user mentioned JSON.\\n\\nWait, should I include units? The population is in people, but the user didn\\'t specify, and I think it\\'s commonly expressed in thousands or millions without units in that context. So I\\'ll provide it as 20,562,000 for clarity.\\n\\nI should also make sure the JSON is valid. So braces and colons should be correctly placed, and the numbers precise. I don\\'t want any typos there. Oh, and it\\'s better to wrap the JSON in triple backticks for readability.\\n\\nDouble-checking: city is Paris, population is 20,562,000, and the format is correct. Yes, that should do it. I think the user is looking for a straightforward answer without any extra fluff, so being precise and concise is key.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 20562000\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 358, 1414, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 12095, 11, 429, 594, 264, 2661, 13, 1988, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 432, 594, 13382, 13, 6771, 752, 1744, 11, 12095, 374, 279, 7772, 3283, 304, 9625, 11, 1290, 30, 21607, 11, 429, 594, 4396, 382, 7039, 11, 279, 7042, 949, 13, 358, 6099, 504, 847, 7822, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 1602, 94451, 3283, 11, 714, 279, 4734, 1372, 374, 2989, 13, 358, 1744, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 1331, 11532, 3526, 11, 7196, 220, 17, 15, 13, 20, 30, 358, 1265, 5312, 15934, 429, 13, 8670, 3783, 11, 1576, 7025, 13604, 2297, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 5978, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 279, 5535, 2500, 382, 40, 1366, 311, 3410, 279, 1429, 705, 4686, 18413, 1995, 11, 773, 8365, 358, 1265, 1401, 369, 279, 1482, 7042, 5109, 13, 358, 1744, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 12095, 594, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 17, 15, 13, 20, 21, 17, 3526, 13, 2938, 4977, 11285, 13, 358, 3278, 990, 429, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1265, 2924, 279, 1376, 330, 8926, 1, 448, 279, 897, 330, 59604, 1335, 323, 2441, 1376, 330, 44441, 1, 448, 279, 1372, 13, 1084, 594, 2664, 311, 3042, 1378, 8651, 10695, 369, 31273, 13, 6771, 752, 3561, 429, 12440, 2041, 894, 50494, 11, 1101, 14396, 4718, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 4718, 382, 14190, 11, 1265, 358, 2924, 8153, 30, 576, 7042, 374, 304, 1251, 11, 714, 279, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 11, 323, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 16626, 13302, 304, 9037, 476, 11728, 2041, 8153, 304, 429, 2266, 13, 2055, 358, 3278, 3410, 432, 438, 220, 17, 15, 11, 20, 21, 17, 11, 15, 15, 15, 369, 31273, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 13, 2055, 59191, 323, 1375, 2382, 1265, 387, 12440, 9099, 11, 323, 279, 5109, 23560, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1366, 894, 13580, 966, 1052, 13, 8670, 11, 323, 432, 594, 2664, 311, 15061, 279, 4718, 304, 23725, 1182, 35078, 369, 91494, 382, 7378, 15934, 287, 25, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 7042, 374, 220, 17, 15, 11, 20, 21, 17, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3561, 374, 4396, 13, 7414, 11, 429, 1265, 653, 432, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 1196, 374, 3330, 369, 264, 30339, 4226, 2041, 894, 4960, 1320, 1362, 11, 773, 1660, 23560, 323, 63594, 374, 1376, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 15, 20, 21, 17, 15, 15, 15, 198, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '33f6b21c61cc4381b3b08b5e84c20c59', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 446, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.0880730152130127, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1770092545.7619267}}</strong>"

      "\n",
      "First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward. Now, I need to find the population. I remember that population figures can change over time, so I should check the most recent data available. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the population of Paris is usually given in approximate numbers because exact counts can be tricky due to factors like migration. Let me recall or look up the approximate population. I believe it's around 2.2 million people. But I'm not 100% sure if that's the current number or if it's from a specific year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should consider including some additional details that might be useful. Maybe the area of the capital, like the administrative region or the Île-de-France metropolitan area. I think the administrative center is the 75th arrondissement. And the metropolitan area of Paris is even larger, perhaps around 12 million people. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure this information in a JSON format as the user requested. So, I'll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, \"population\" for the city, \"administrative_center\" for the arrondissement, and \"metropolitan_area\" for the larger area. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Also, the population numbers should be accurate. I'm a bit uncertain about the exact numbers, but I think 2.17 million is a commonly cited figure for the city, and 12.4 million for the metropolitan area. \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a main object with the key \"france\" containing the details. Within that, the \"capital\" key holds the name, population, administrative center, and metropolitan area. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should double-check these numbers to ensure accuracy, but given that I'm a bit unsure, I'll go with the commonly accepted approximate figures. That way, the user gets a clear and concise answer in the correct format.\n",
