    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '86513f39445242a6b2916222064b0d0e', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.423654317855835, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1763565065.1263857}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so I need to figure out how to provide the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me start by recalling what the capital of France is. I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s Paris, but just to be safe, I\\'ll double-check that real quick. Yes, Paris is definitely the capital. \\n\\nNext, I need to find out the population of Paris. I remember that major cities in France have significant populations, and Paris is one of the most populous. However, I\\'m not exactly sure about the exact number. I think it\\'s in the millions, maybe around eight or nine million? I know that France\\'s total population is roughly 40 million, so Paris must be a significant portion of that.\\n\\nWait, I think I might have heard that Paris has a population of about 8.5 million. But I should verify if that\\'s correct. Let me think about other cities in France. For Paris, I recall that the population figures can vary depending on whether we include just the urban area or the broader metropolitan area. Sometimes, the metropolitan area is considered about 12 million, but the urban zone itself is closer to 8.5 million. \\n\\nI\\'m trying to remember if the latest data from the National Institute of Statistics (ISTN) in France has updated the population recently. As of 2023, I believe the urban area of Paris had a population of approximately 8.75 million, and the metropolitan area was around 12.1 million. \\n\\nSo, putting this together, I need to structure this information in JSON format. The user asked for a JSON with the information and population of Paris. I should create an object that has a \"name\" field for the city name, a \"description\" that states it\\'s the capital, a \"population\" field with the accurate figure, and perhaps a \"fact\" that provides additional context or interesting tidbit about the population.\\n\\nNow, considering the exact year of the population, I\\'ll assume the data is current and perhaps from 2023. I should also format the JSON correctly, ensuring that the keys are in double quotes and the string values are properly enclosed as well. \\n\\nWait, I just thought, maybe I should check the source of the information to make sure it\\'s reliable. The National Institute of Statistics (ISTN) is the most authoritative source for such data, so including that information in the JSON as a source where the data was retrieved from would be good, although the user didn\\'t specify if they wanted that. But adding it might make the JSON more informative.\\n\\nAlternatively, I could just provide the number without the source, but for thoroughness, it\\'s better to include where the data comes from. So I\\'ll structure the JSON with the city\\'s details, its population, a fact, and the source.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \"city\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"description\": \"The capital of France\",\\n    \"population\": 8750000,\\n    \"fact\": \"Paris has a significant portion of France\\'s population\",\\n    \"source\": \"National Institute of Statistics (ISTN)\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nI think that covers all the necessary information. The population figure I\\'ve used is 8,750,000, which is around the figure I recalled earlier. I should make sure that the numbers are accurately represented, using commas for readability. Also, the structure should be clean and easy to understand.\\n\\nI wonder if I should include more details in the \\'fact\\' field. Maybe something about the city\\'s landmarks or history tied to its population. But since the user only asked for information about the city and its population, it\\'s probably best to keep it concise unless they ask for more.\\n\\nIn summary, I\\'ll create a JSON object with the name, description, population number, a fact, and the source of the population data. That should be comprehensive and meet the user\\'s request accurately.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the JSON-formatted information about the capital of France, Paris, including its population:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"description\": \"The capital of France\",\\n    \"population\": 8750000,\\n    \"fact\": \"Paris has a population of approximately 8.75 million and is known for its rich historical and cultural significance.\",\\n    \"source\": \"National Institute of Statistics (ISTN)\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON includes the city\\'s name, description, population figure, an interesting fact, and the source of the population data.', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 1246, 311, 3410, 279, 1995, 323,

I think the user will provide the data in a structured way, maybe with some additional details like the country's capital and population. Let me make sure I understand what they're asking for. The capital of France is definitely Paris. Now, I need the population number. I remember that Paris is the most populous city in France, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact number. I think it's around 2 million, but I might be off. Maybe I should check that. Also, I should consider if there are any recent estimates because population numbers can change over time. \n",
