    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'c2b59ebad2474f8e9e9bfb489fcb50e6', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'queue_time': 0.00027568405494093895, 'prefill_delay': 0.000557492021471262, 'prefill_latency': 0.011465216055512428, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 1, 'e2e_latency': 3.0356979370117188, 'request_received_ts': 1762661485.0289207, 'request_scheduled_ts': 1762661485.0294106, 'decode_finished_ts': 1762661488.0646186, 'forward_time': 3.034555622842163, 'response_sent_ts': 1762661488.0646803}}\n"

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France, which is straightforward—Paris. Then, I should gather relevant data about Paris. The key points would be the population, the辕门 district, euro area metropolitan area, and the metropolitan area population.\\n\\nI should look up the current population figures. Be cautious about whether the population provided is as of a specific year. oftentimes, population data can fluctuate, so it\\'s good to mention that the information is approximate and based on recent estimates.\\n\\nNext, the Dakar-Versailles district is a significant cultural and administrative area within Paris. Including its population figures gives a clearer picture of Paris\\'s demographics.\\n\\nAlso, the Euro Area metropolitan area includes regions beyond just Paris, like Île-de-France. Including the population there adds context about the broader area\\'s population.\\n\\nNow, structuring this into JSON. I should create a main object that includes the key details, and an additional object for the metropolitan area if it\\'s needed. Since the user might need detailed breakdowns, it\\'s helpful to have separate sections for District Population and Metropolitan Area Population.\\n\\nI should ensure the JSON syntax is correct. Start with curly braces for the main object, list the keys, and assign their corresponding values. Each value should be enclosed in double quotes or backticks for consistency.\\n\\nAlso, adding a comment to explain that the population data is approximate is important, as it sets the record that the figures might change over time.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a clear and readable format, making sure it\\'s easy for the user to understand and use.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": {\\n    \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n    \"official_name\": \"City of Paris\",\\n    \"region\": \" Île-de-France\",\\n    \"area\": \"12.55 km²\",\\n    \"population\": \"Approximately 2.15 million (as of 2023 estimates)\",\\n    \"dakarVERSAILLES District Population\": \"692,408\",\\n    \"euroArea Metropolitan Area Population\": \"7,953,200\"\\n  },\\n  \"description\": \"Paris is the capital and most populous city in France.

Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the most recent data I have.\n",

      "Now, the user wants the information in JSON format. JSON is a data format that's easy to read and write for both humans and machines. I'll need to structure it properly with keys and values.

      "Also, I should consider the user's possible intent. They might be a student working on a project, someone writing an article, or maybe a casual user checking facts. Either way, providing accurate and concise information is key. I should avoid any unnecessary details and stick to what's being asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to think about is the date of the population figure. Is it the latest available? If the user needs it for a current project, I should mention that the figure is as of recent data. It's good to be transparent about that in case they need the most up-to-date information.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also make sure the response is clear and not too technical. Since the user is asking for a simple JSON, I don't need to overcomplicate things. Just straightforward data.\n",
