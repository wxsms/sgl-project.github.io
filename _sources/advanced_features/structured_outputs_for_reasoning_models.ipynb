    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '0314dd8554354ab0be0129e52b7b6ce0', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3434793949127197, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1767104468.2366743}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, I just got a query from a user asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what the exact requirements are. They specifically want the capital, so that\\'s straightforward—Paris. But they also want the population, so I should check the latest data. I remember that population figures can change, especially with recent censuses or events like referendums.\\n\\nI should make sure to get the most recent population number, maybe from 2022 since that\\'s the latest I recall. Paris has a diverse population, so I need to present it accurately. I\\'ll look up the current estimate to ensure it\\'s up-to-date.\\n\\nNext, the user asked for JSON format, so I\\'ll need to structure the information neatly. It looks like they provided an example with \"capital\" and \"population\", so I\\'ll follow that structure. I should also include geographical details like the administrative region, department, and area since that makes the information more comprehensive.\\n\\nWait, I think the department number for Paris is 92, right? And the area is around 105 square kilometers, which I should check to confirm. Also, Paris is known for having a large proportion of the population living in the urban agglomeration, not just the administrative city limits. So including that percentage adds more context.\\n\\nI should make sure the JSON isn\\'t too complicated. They provided an example, so sticking to their format is key. Also, to keep the Typed JSON valid, I\\'ll use proper casing and syntax, like using double quotes for strings and commas correctly between keys.\\n\\nNow, about the population. The administrative capital is Paris, but the population is spread out. The urban agglomeration includes major towns nearby, and the metropolitan area is even larger. I should present these as separate data points for clarity.\\n\\nI need to ensure that the JSON is easy to parse and looks clean. Using line breaks appropriately after each key-value pair will make it more readable. Also, avoiding any markdown formatting since the user specified JSON and provided an example without any extra text.\\n\\nLet me double-check the numbers: Paris\\' population is around 5.5 million as of 2022, and the urban area is about 10.5 million. The metropolitan area is approximately 19 million.

      "Generated text: Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out which city is the capital of France. From what I know, Paris is the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to find out the population of Paris. I'm pretty sure the population is in the millions, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. I think it's around 2 million. But wait, maybe I should double-check that. I remember reading somewhere that the population is roughly 2.1 or 2.2 million. I'll go with approximately 2.17 million to keep it accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to format this correctly with proper syntax. The key should be \"capital,\" and the value should be another object containing \"city\" and \"population.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON is valid. Each key should be in quotes, and string values should be in double quotes. The numbers should be correctly formatted without any extra spaces. Also, the entire structure should be an object within square brackets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON should have an array with one element. The element is an object with two properties: \"city\" and \"population.\" The city is \"Paris,\" and the population is 2170000. I need to ensure that the commas are in the right place to avoid any syntax errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, does the user want just the JSON or something else? They mentioned the capital, so one city. No need for multiple capitals. Also, they didn't specify the date, so I'll just include the population as a number without a timestamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's all. I should present the JSON correctly so the user can easily read and use it. Maybe they're working on a project or a presentation where they need precise data in a structured format. Providing it in JSON makes it easy for them to integrate or analyze the information further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, I feel confident that the JSON is accurate and meets the user's request. I'll make sure to present it clearly without any markdown, just plain text within the JSON brackets.\n",
