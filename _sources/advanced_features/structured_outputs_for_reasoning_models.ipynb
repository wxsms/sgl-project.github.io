    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '528d2499955041b9a3817218b31568fe', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'queue_time': 0.0001805969513952732, 'prefill_delay': 0.00042090099304914474, 'prefill_latency': 0.009882347076199949, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.3250982761383057, 'request_received_ts': 1762413184.3251522, 'request_scheduled_ts': 1762413184.3256328, 'decode_finished_ts': 1762413186.6502504, 'forward_time': 2.324168969062157, 'response_sent_ts': 1762413186.6502988}}</strong>"

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user just asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down step by step to make sure I get it right. \\n\\nFirst, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That part\\'s pretty straightforward. But wait, I should double-check to make sure I\\'m not mixing up the capital with another country. No, Paris is definitely the首都. \\n\\nNext, the user wants the population. Hmm, I remember that Paris has a large population, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the current figure. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but maybe more recent data would say differently. I should look up the latest estimates. Let me recall... I believe the population was around 3,600,000 in 2021. Maybe now it\\'s a bit higher? I don\\'t know the exact number, but I\\'ll go with the 2021 figure for now.\\n\\nNow, the user specifically asked for a JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to format this into a JSON object. So, it should be an object with a key \"capital\" that has the value \"Paris,\" and another key \"population\" with the number, making sure it\\'s in a numerical format in JSON. So, it would look like {\"capital\": \"Paris\", \"population\": 3600000}.\\n\\nWait, but should I provide the exact current population? Since I\\'m recalling it\\'s around 3.6 million, maybe I should include that caution. Oh, but the user didn\\'t ask for specific sources or the latest data, just the information. So I\\'ll proceed with the figure I have, but perhaps mention that the population figure is approximate.\\n\\nAlso, formatting: in JSON, everything is in double quotes, and commas are used to separate key-value pairs. So the entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. \\n\\nI should make sure there are no typos or missing commas. Let me count: opening curly, then the keys with quotes, commas between them, and the closing curly. Looks good.\\n\\nIs there anything else? The user didn\\'t ask for anything else, so this should suffice. \\n\\nWait, should I look up the exact population to be precise? Yeah, I think it\\'s better to be accurate. Let me check a reliable source. According to recent data, as of 2023, Paris has a population of about 3,681,000. Oh, but the user didn\\'t specify the year, so maybe it\\'s better to use the most recent estimate they might have. Alternatively, just stick with the commonly cited figure unless instructed otherwise.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ll proceed with 3,600,000 as the population, understanding that it\\'s an estimate and could vary slightly. \\n\\nFinalizing the JSON structure, I think that\\'s all the user needs. They were straightforward about the format, so keeping it simple with two key-value pairs in JSON is appropriate. No additional information is required unless specified.\\n\\nPhew, that wasn\\'t too bad. Just a bit of checking, but I think I\\'ve got it covered.
