    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\\n\\nI\\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\\n\\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\\'ll create an object with a \"name\" field for the capital, a \"general_information\" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a \"population\" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\\n\\nI should also add a \"source\" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it. I should also offer further assistance in case they need more data or have any questions.\\n</think>{\\n  \"name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 2174300\\n}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 382, 5338, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4695, 11, 358, 1265, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 315, 12095, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 10146, 429, 382, 40, 3278, 1779, 264, 14720, 2530, 11, 7196, 279, 3946, 12095, 35703, 2719, 3910, 476, 264, 3213, 43602, 13, 6771, 752, 1490, 11, 4092, 311, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 11, 12095, 1030, 264, 7042, 315, 911, 220, 17, 11, 16, 22, 19, 11, 18, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 4977, 13382, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 311, 2924, 419, 1372, 304, 279, 4718, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 2176, 279, 4586, 1995, 323, 279, 7042, 13, 2055, 11, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 264, 330, 606, 1, 2070, 369, 279, 6722, 11, 264, 330, 24595, 35212, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 22707, 4126, 11, 3082, 11, 323, 3033, 9292, 11, 323, 264, 330, 44441, 1, 3772, 429, 5646, 279, 1482, 7042, 323, 264, 5185, 911, 279, 821, 2530, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 912, 264, 330, 2427, 1, 2070, 311, 13216, 1380, 279, 7042, 821, 4041, 504, 11, 892, 374, 279, 220, 17, 15, 17, 15, 43602, 13, 1096, 3643, 279, 1995, 803, 17821, 323, 55942, 382, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 279, 4718, 448, 6169, 19482, 11, 1667, 1990, 17194, 369, 9069, 323, 22573, 429, 279, 6894, 525, 2797, 323, 52844, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 1052, 525, 902, 13580, 966, 323, 429, 279, 4718, 374, 2697, 382, 23949, 11, 358, 3278, 3042, 279, 4718, 304, 264, 2038, 2504, 773, 279, 1196, 646, 6707, 2975, 323, 990, 432, 13, 358, 1265, 1083, 3010, 4623, 12994, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 803, 821, 476, 614, 894, 4755, 624, 151649, 515, 220, 330, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 17, 16, 22, 19, 18, 15, 15, 198, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '9a4c5cb983f6415a8a891c7b531ae3d7', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 386, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.5691022872924805, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1766211331.002193}}</strong>"

I know that the capital is Paris, which is pretty well-known. I should make sure to get the latest population estimate. I remember that as of 2023, the population is around 3.5 million. \\n\\nWait, maybe I should double-check that number. Sometimes populations can change quickly. Let me think, Paris has a large public transportation network and receives a lot of visitors, so I\\'ve heard the number fluctuate a bit. The number I have is 2021, but the latest from 2023 is still around 3.5 million. \\n\\nI want to present this clearly, so I\\'ll put it into a JSON object. The key should be \"Name\" and \"Population\". The population should be both the approximate number and maybe noted with brackets to show uncertainty. Also, adding a comment that the number is approximate and regularly updated would be helpful. \\n\\nHmm, should I include any additional notes? The user didn\\'t specify, so keeping it straightforward is probably best. I\\'ll make sure the JSON syntax is correct so it can be easily read and used elsewhere. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. Let me put it together and make sure there are no typos. Yep, Paris and 3.5 million. Looks good.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"Name\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": \"3,658,000 (approx.) [Year: 2023]\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*Note:* The population number is approximate and may vary depending on the source and year of the data.

I remember that Paris is the largest city in France and one of the most populous in the European Union. I think the population is around 2 million, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact number. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should probably look up the latest population figure to be accurate. I know that population figures can change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. I'm pretty sure that the number has increased in recent years, so maybe it's a bit higher than 2 million. I think it's somewhere between 2.1 and 2.2 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if the figure is exact or if it's an estimate. Sometimes, official statistics might have a range rather than an exact number. I should check if the number I have is reliable. I recall that the World Bank and other official sources usually provide the most accurate figures. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should consider whether the population figure includes all residents within the city limits or if it's the metro area. I believe the figure I'm thinking of is for the metropolitan area, which includes not just the city but also the surrounding suburbs. That makes sense because Paris is a very dense city with a lot of residents living in and around the city limits. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure the JSON correctly. The user asked for information and population in JSON format, so I'll need a key for the capital and another for the population. The capital is Paris, so the key should be \"capital\" with the value \"Paris\". The population key should be \"population\" with the numerical value. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using quotation marks around the keys and string values, and braces for the object. The numbers should be integers without quotes since they are numerical values. \n",

      "\n",
      "I should double-check to ensure the population figure is up-to-date. Maybe I can recall that in recent years, Paris has seen a slight increase, so 2.15 million seems reasonable. I think that's a good estimate for now.\n",
