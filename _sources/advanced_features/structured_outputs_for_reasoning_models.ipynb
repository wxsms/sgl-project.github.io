    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

Hmm, that\\'s straightforward, but I should make sure I get all the details right. Let me start by identifying which city is the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s where we\\'re focusing. \\n\\nNow, I need to find the most recent population data for Paris. I remember that populations can change every year due to births, deaths, and migration. I think the last reliable data might be from 2021. Let me check the approximate population number. I believe it\\'s around 2,167,000 people. That sounds correct, but I\\'m not entirely sure if it\\'s up to date. Populations can fluctuate, so maybe I should mention that the figure is approximate.\\n\\nNext, I should structure this information in a JSON format as the user requested. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so the keys would be \"City\" and \"Population\". The value for each key would be a string containing the country name and the number. I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct—no trailing commas, proper quotation marks, and indentation for readability.\\n\\nWait, should I include any additional details? Maybe a place summary line to make it clear. That way, the user knows exactly what the JSON represents. So I\\'ll add a \"Summary\" field that states the city is the capital of France and provides the population figure.\\n\\nI also need to consider the format. The user wants it in JSON, so I\\'ll present it neatly with proper indentation. If I were to write this in code, it would be straightforward, but since it\\'s just JSON text, I\\'ll format it with each key on a new line for clarity.\\n\\nLet me double-check the population figure. A quick search confirms that as of 2023, Paris\\'s population is approximately 2,167,000. Okay, so that number is solid. \\n\\nShould I mention that the data is as of a specific date? In JSON, that\\'s not necessary unless the user specifies, but including it could add context. Maybe something like adding a note in the summary, like \"as of 2023.\" That way, the information is clear and useful.\\n\\nI think that\\'s everything. The user just needs the JSON with the city name and population, so providing it in the specified format should meet their needs. No need for anything more complicated unless they ask for additional details, but keeping it simple is probably best.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information about the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"City\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"Population\": \"约为2,167,000\",\\n  \"Summary\": \"巴黎是法国的首都，其人口约为2,167,000人（截至2023年）\"\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 1101, 4588, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 429, 594, 30339, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 358, 633, 678, 279, 3565, 1290, 13, 6771, 752, 1191, 553, 24588, 892, 3283, 374, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 1380, 582, 2299, 21080, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 821, 369, 12095, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 21910, 646, 2297, 1449, 1042, 4152, 311, 65232, 11, 16375, 11, 323, 11906, 13, 358, 1744, 279, 1537, 14720, 821, 2578, 387, 504, 220, 17, 15, 17, 16, 13, 6771, 752, 1779, 279, 44868, 7042, 1372, 13, 358, 4411, 432, 594, 2163, 220, 17, 11, 16, 21, 22, 11, 15, 15, 15, 1251, 13, 2938, 10362, 4396, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 11368, 2704, 421, 432, 594, 705, 311, 2400, 13, 10254, 7455, 646, 38288, 6292, 11, 773, 7196, 358, 1265, 6286, 429, 279, 7071, 374, 44868, 382, 5847, 11, 358, 1265, 5944, 419, 1995, 304, 264, 4718, 3561, 438, 279, 1196, 11223, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 279, 6894, 1035, 387, 330, 12730, 1, 323, 330, 53371, 3263, 576, 897, 369, 1817, 1376, 1035, 387, 264, 914, 8482, 279, 3146, 829, 323, 279, 1372, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 4718, 19482, 374, 4396, 2293, 2152, 27748, 76602, 11, 6169, 54231, 15423, 11, 323, 69592, 369, 91494, 382, 14190, 11, 1265, 358, 2924, 894, 5107, 3565, 30, 10696, 264, 1992, 12126, 1555, 311, 1281, 432, 2797, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 8788, 6896, 1128, 279, 4718, 10868, 13, 2055, 358, 3278, 912, 264, 330, 19237, 1, 2070, 429, 5302, 279, 3283, 374, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 323, 5707, 279, 7042, 7071, 382, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 2908, 279, 3561, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 432, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 3042, 432, 62166, 448, 6169, 69592, 13, 1416, 358, 1033, 311, 3270, 419, 304, 2038, 11, 432, 1035, 387, 30339, 11, 714, 2474, 432, 594, 1101, 4718, 1467, 11, 358, 3278, 3561, 432, 448, 1817, 1376, 389, 264, 501, 1555, 369, 31273, 382, 10061, 752, 1990, 15934, 279, 7042, 7071, 13, 362, 3974, 2711, 42396, 429, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 12095, 594, 7042, 374, 13187, 220, 17, 11, 16, 21, 22, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 35439, 11, 773, 429, 1372, 374, 6437, 13, 4710, 14996, 358, 6286, 429, 279, 821, 374, 438, 315, 264, 3151, 2400, 30, 758, 4718, 11, 429, 594, 537, 5871, 7241, 279, 1196, 29102, 11, 714, 2670, 432, 1410, 912, 2266, 13, 10696, 2494, 1075, 7842, 264, 5185, 304, 279, 12126, 11, 1075, 330, 300, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 1189, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1995, 374, 2797, 323, 5390, 382, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 4297, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 4718, 448, 279, 3283, 829, 323, 7042, 11, 773, 8241, 432, 304, 279, 5189, 3561, 1265, 3367, 862, 3880, 13, 2308, 1184, 369, 4113, 803, 16965, 7241, 807, 2548, 369, 5107, 3565, 11, 714, 10282, 432, 4285, 374, 4658, 1850, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 911, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 320, 59604, 8, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 12730, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 53371, 788, 330, 107679, 17, 11, 16, 21, 22, 11, 15, 15, 15, 756, 220, 330, 19237, 788, 330, 106004, 20412, 104328, 9370, 106114, 3837, 41146, 102055, 107679, 17, 11, 16, 21, 22, 11, 15, 15, 15, 17340, 9909, 102219, 17, 15, 17, 18, 7948, 7552, 698, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '5bf5b4c65543470d839d546700252933', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 606, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 3.8650503158569336, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1764082373.8153465}}</strong>"

      "Alright, Paris is definitely the capital. Now, I should gather the population data. Population numbers can change over time, so I need the most recent estimate. I remember that the population of Paris is over 3 million, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact figure. I think it's around 3.5 million as of 2023, but I should confirm that. Maybe I can recall that the population was about 2.2 million in the 19th century, but that's way back. \n",

It's a major cultural and economic center, home to the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and the Opera. It's also a global city known for its fashion and design industries. Including that would make the JSON more informative. \n",

The user wants it in JSON format, so I should create an object with an \"info\" key containing the city name, a \"population\" key with the number and year, and an \"interesting_facts\" array with bullet points. I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotes.\n",

      "Wait, I should also consider the format of the population. It's better to represent it as a number without commas for readability, so 3500000 instead of 3,500,000. Also, the year should be current or recent to ensure accuracy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me put it all together. The city name is Paris. Population is 3500000 as of 2023. The interesting facts should be concise and relevant. Maybe include its status as a global city, the Eiffel Tower, cultural landmarks, and economic importance. \n",
