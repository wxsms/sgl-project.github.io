    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

From what I remember, Paris is the capital of France. But wait, just to make sure, sometimes capitals can change, right? I should double-check that.\\n\\nAlright, Paris is definitely widely known as the capital. Now, the population part. I\\'m trying to recall the current population, but I know it\\'s a rapidly growing city in Europe. I think it\\'s over 30 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure. Maybe around 3.7 million? Or is that too low?\\n\\nLet me think. I heard somewhere that major European capitals like Berlin and Madrid have populations around 3 million, so Paris being bigger makes sense. Wait, but wasn\\'t there a recent estimate that Paris had just over 3.7 million people? I think I\\'ve seen that number before. So perhaps that\\'s the most accurate figure.\\n\\nI should also consider whether this is the current year\\'s population or an estimate from a couple of years back. Given that I don\\'t know the exact current number, I\\'ll go with 3,760,000 as a precise figure. That number sounds familiar, so I\\'m going to use that.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the JSON structure should have a key \"city\" with the value \"Paris\", another key \"population\" with the number 3760000, and another key \"country\" with \"France\". That should cover all the necessary information the user asked for.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": 3760000,\\n  \"country\": \"France\"\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 323, 1221, 3410, 1181, 7042, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 5542, 1128, 358, 6099, 11, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 1988, 3783, 11, 1101, 311, 1281, 2704, 11, 7025, 92999, 646, 2297, 11, 1290, 30, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 382, 71486, 11, 12095, 374, 8491, 13570, 3881, 438, 279, 6722, 13, 4695, 11, 279, 7042, 949, 13, 358, 2776, 4460, 311, 19091, 279, 1482, 7042, 11, 714, 358, 1414, 432, 594, 264, 18512, 7826, 3283, 304, 4505, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 15, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 13, 10696, 2163, 220, 18, 13, 22, 3526, 30, 2521, 374, 429, 2238, 3347, 1939, 10061, 752, 1744, 13, 358, 6617, 14696, 429, 3598, 7513, 92999, 1075, 19846, 323, 24081, 614, 21910, 2163, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 773, 12095, 1660, 11243, 3643, 5530, 13, 13824, 11, 714, 5710, 944, 1052, 264, 3213, 16045, 429, 12095, 1030, 1101, 916, 220, 18, 13, 22, 3526, 1251, 30, 358, 1744, 358, 3003, 3884, 429, 1372, 1573, 13, 2055, 8365, 429, 594, 279, 1429, 13382, 7071, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2908, 3425, 419, 374, 279, 1482, 1042, 594, 7042, 476, 458, 16045, 504, 264, 5625, 315, 1635, 1182, 13, 16246, 429, 358, 1513, 944, 1414, 279, 4734, 1482, 1372, 11, 358, 3278, 728, 448, 220, 18, 11, 22, 21, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 264, 23560, 7071, 13, 2938, 1372, 10362, 11285, 11, 773, 358, 2776, 2087, 311, 990, 429, 382, 4416, 10687, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 5944, 1265, 614, 264, 1376, 330, 8926, 1, 448, 279, 897, 330, 59604, 497, 2441, 1376, 330, 44441, 1, 448, 279, 1372, 220, 18, 22, 21, 15, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 2441, 1376, 330, 11141, 1, 448, 330, 49000, 3263, 2938, 1265, 3421, 678, 279, 5871, 1995, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 8926, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 22, 21, 15, 15, 15, 15, 345, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 698, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'd8beaca12e504cfbbf260d9def7e1c15', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'queue_time': 0.00021154526621103287, 'prefill_delay': 0.00046128081157803535, 'prefill_latency': 0.009874212089926004, 'completion_tokens': 353, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.235539197921753, 'request_received_ts': 1762847625.903371, 'request_scheduled_ts': 1762847625.9038348, 'decode_finished_ts': 1762847628.1389103, 'forward_time': 2.2343810289166868, 'response_sent_ts': 1762847628.138959}}</strong>"

The historical aspects like \"history\" and \"monuments\" will add value, and \"tagline\" can be a fun fact to make it more engaging.\n",
