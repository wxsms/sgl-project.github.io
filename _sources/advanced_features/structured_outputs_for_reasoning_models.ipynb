    "# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:\n",
    "- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n",

       "<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\\'s straightforward. \\n\\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\\'s over 3 million, but I\\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \\n\\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \\n\\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\\'ll create an object with keys like \"city\", \"population\", and maybe \"country\" since the user mentioned France. \\n\\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\\'ll format this into a JSON object. \\n\\nI also need to present this in a way that\\'s easy to read, so I\\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\\'s valid, but since I\\'m just writing it out, I\\'ll assume it\\'s correct based on my knowledge. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all. The user just needs the information in JSON, so this should satisfy their request.\\n</think>{\\n\\n\"name\": \"Paris\",\\n\"population\": 3500000}', 'output_ids': [32313, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 6771, 752, 1438, 419, 1495, 13, 5512, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 10542, 1128, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 374, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 12095, 374, 279, 6722, 11, 773, 429, 594, 30339, 13, 4710, 5847, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 7042, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 12095, 374, 264, 3598, 3283, 11, 773, 1181, 7042, 374, 5008, 3460, 13, 358, 1744, 432, 594, 916, 220, 18, 3526, 11, 714, 358, 2776, 537, 6896, 2704, 315, 279, 4734, 1372, 13, 10696, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 429, 13, 4710, 14190, 11, 358, 19091, 429, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 13289, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 323, 279, 1042, 13, 576, 1196, 3207, 944, 13837, 264, 3953, 1042, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 4658, 728, 448, 279, 1429, 3213, 16045, 13, 358, 4411, 279, 7042, 374, 2163, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 438, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 13, 4710, 7039, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 419, 1995, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 13, 4718, 11136, 5711, 1376, 19083, 13530, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1855, 458, 1633, 448, 6894, 1075, 330, 8926, 497, 330, 44441, 497, 323, 7196, 330, 11141, 1, 2474, 279, 1196, 9733, 9625, 13, 4710, 40, 1265, 1281, 2704, 279, 6894, 525, 304, 6364, 311, 2506, 432, 2797, 13, 576, 3283, 374, 12095, 11, 279, 7042, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 11, 323, 279, 3146, 374, 9625, 13, 358, 3278, 3561, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 1633, 13, 4710, 40, 1083, 1184, 311, 3042, 419, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 594, 4135, 311, 1349, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 990, 6169, 19482, 448, 54231, 15423, 323, 76602, 304, 279, 1290, 7482, 13, 2308, 27748, 76602, 311, 5648, 5975, 13, 4710, 97904, 432, 678, 3786, 11, 279, 4718, 1265, 1401, 2494, 1075, 419, 25, 264, 10997, 448, 279, 6894, 323, 279, 12159, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 311, 1273, 432, 311, 5978, 432, 594, 2697, 11, 714, 2474, 358, 2776, 1101, 4378, 432, 700, 11, 358, 3278, 9658, 432, 594, 4396, 3118, 389, 847, 6540, 13, 4710, 40, 1744, 429, 594, 678, 13, 576, 1196, 1101, 3880, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 11, 773, 419, 1265, 26553, 862, 1681, 624, 151649, 4257, 1, 606, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 1, 44441, 788, 220, 18, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 92, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '2b92a7accb6d468782a12139eb6c018f', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 405, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 5.111326694488525, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1762922647.3370686}}</strong>"

I know the capital is Paris, so I should start by confirming that. Next, I need to find the most recent population figures. I remember that the population has been growing, so I should look up the latest data. Maybe around 2022? \\n\\nI think the population figure is approximately 3,700,000. That\\'s the number I seem to recall, but I should double-check to be sure. Also, it\\'s important to note that the population is projected to increase further. The growth rate is often cited as around 0.83%, which would mean each year, the population goes up that percentage.\\n\\nThinking about where to get this information, official sources like the Institut National de la Statistique and Documents (INSM) would be reliable. They usually have the most accurate and up-to-date statistics. I should mention that the data is from the latest estimates or projections to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nPutting this into a JSON format, I need to structure it clearly. The user wants information in a JSON, so I\\'ll make sure it\\'s well-formatted. I\\'ll include the key points like the city name, population, current status as the capital, the latest population figure, and the growth rate. That way, the user gets all the necessary details in a concise and easy-to-read format.\\n\\nI should also keep the language simple and straightforward since the user might not have specified a particular audience or depth level. Assuming they need a factual and concise response, sticking to the main points is key. Maybe they\\'re a student, a researcher, or someone else needing this data for a project or report.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"capital\": \"Paris\",\\n  \"population\": \"Approximately 3,700,000\",\\n  \"capital饰品\": \"The capital of France\",\\n  \"population_trend\": \"Population growth rate: 0.83% (latest estimates)\"\\n}\\n```', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 279, 1196, 374, 10161, 369, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 13, 358, 1414, 279, 6722, 374, 12095, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1191, 553, 48996, 429, 13, 9295, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 1429, 3213, 7042, 12396, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 7042, 702, 1012, 7826, 11, 773, 358, 1265, 1401, 705, 279, 5535, 821, 13, 10696, 2163, 220, 17, 15, 17, 17, 30, 4710, 40, 1744, 279, 7042, 7071, 374, 13187, 220, 18, 11, 22, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 13, 2938, 594, 279, 1372, 358, 2803, 311, 19091, 11, 714, 358, 1265, 1990, 15934, 311, 387, 2704, 13, 7281, 11, 432, 594, 2989, 311, 5185, 429, 279, 7042, 374, 27348, 311, 5263, 4623, 13, 576, 6513, 4379, 374, 3545, 21870, 438, 2163, 220, 15, 13, 23, 18, 13384, 892, 1035, 3076, 1817, 1042, 11, 279, 7042, 5780, 705, 429, 11414, 382, 93945, 911, 1380, 311, 633, 419, 1995, 11, 3946, 8173, 1075, 279, 95462, 5055, 409, 1187, 12166, 96396, 323, 44790, 320, 687, 9501, 8, 1035, 387, 14720, 13, 2379, 5990, 614, 279, 1429, 13382, 323, 705, 4686, 18413, 13142, 13, 358, 1265, 6286, 429, 279, 821, 374, 504, 279, 5535, 17530, 476, 40479, 311, 5978, 13403, 382, 97904, 419, 1119, 264, 4718, 3561, 11, 358, 1184, 311, 5944, 432, 9355, 13, 576, 1196, 6801, 1995, 304, 264, 4718, 11, 773, 358, 3278, 1281, 2704, 432, 594, 1632, 8460, 12127, 13, 358, 3278, 2924, 279, 1376, 3501, 1075, 279, 3283, 829, 11, 7042, 11, 1482, 2639, 438, 279, 6722, 11, 279, 5535, 7042, 7071, 11, 323, 279, 6513, 4379, 13, 2938, 1616, 11, 279, 1196, 5221, 678, 279, 5871, 3565, 304, 264, 63594, 323, 4135, 4686, 28806, 3561, 382, 40, 1265, 1083, 2506, 279, 4128, 4285, 323, 30339, 2474, 279, 1196, 2578, 537, 614, 5189, 264, 3953, 10650, 476, 7990, 2188, 13, 63964, 807, 1184, 264, 59901, 323, 63594, 2033, 11, 36972, 311, 279, 1887, 3501, 374, 1376, 13, 10696, 807, 2299, 264, 5458, 11, 264, 31085, 11, 476, 4325, 770, 32821, 419, 821, 369, 264, 2390, 476, 1895, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 323, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 330, 69520, 7108, 220, 18, 11, 22, 15, 15, 11, 15, 15, 15, 756, 220, 330, 65063, 112034, 788, 330, 785, 6722, 315, 9625, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 528, 9300, 788, 330, 53371, 6513, 4379, 25, 220, 15, 13, 23, 18, 4, 320, 19350, 17530, 12954, 532, 73594, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': 'b181aa3d40f24f23a48657458c386cbe', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 430, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'e2e_latency': 2.720411777496338, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1762922664.917774}}</strong>"
