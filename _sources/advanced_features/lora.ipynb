    "SGLang enables the use of [LoRA adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) with a base model. By incorporating techniques from [S-LoRA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03285) and [Punica](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18547), SGLang can efficiently support multiple LoRA adapters for different sequences within a single batch of inputs."

   "source": [
    "The following server arguments are relevant for multi-LoRA serving:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `enable_lora`: Enable LoRA support for the model. This argument is automatically set to True if `--lora-paths` is provided for backward compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lora_paths`: The list of LoRA adapters to load. Each adapter must be specified in one of the following formats: <PATH> | <NAME>=<PATH> | JSON with schema {\"lora_name\":str,\"lora_path\":str,\"pinned\":bool}.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `max_loras_per_batch`: Maximum number of adaptors used by each batch. This argument can affect the amount of GPU memory reserved for multi-LoRA serving, so it should be set to a smaller value when memory is scarce. Defaults to be 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `max_loaded_loras`: If specified, it limits the maximum number of LoRA adapters loaded in CPU memory at a time. The value must be greater than or equal to `max-loras-per-batch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lora_eviction_policy`: LoRA adapter eviction policy when GPU memory pool is full. `lru`: Least Recently Used (default, better cache efficiency). `fifo`: First-In-First-Out.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lora_backend`: The backend of running GEMM kernels for Lora modules. Currently we support Triton LoRA backend (`triton`) and Chunked SGMV backend (`csgmv`). In the future, faster backend built upon Cutlass or Cuda kernels will be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `max_lora_rank`: The maximum LoRA rank that should be supported. If not specified, it will be automatically inferred from the adapters provided in `--lora-paths`. This argument is needed when you expect to dynamically load adapters of larger LoRA rank after server startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lora_target_modules`: The union set of all target modules where LoRA should be applied (e.g., `q_proj`, `k_proj`, `gate_proj`). If not specified, it will be automatically inferred from the adapters provided in `--lora-paths`. This argument is needed when you expect to dynamically load adapters of different target modules after server startup. You can also set it to `all` to enable LoRA for all supported modules. However, enabling LoRA on additional modules introduces a minor performance overhead. If your application is performance-sensitive, we recommend only specifying the modules for which you plan to load adapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `--max-lora-chunk-size`: Maximum chunk size for the ChunkedSGMV LoRA backend. Only used when --lora-backend is 'csgmv'. Choosing a larger value might improve performance. Please tune this value based on your hardware and workload as needed. Defaults to 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tp_size`: LoRA serving along with Tensor Parallelism is supported by SGLang. `tp_size` controls the number of GPUs for tensor parallelism. More details on the tensor sharding strategy can be found in [S-Lora](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03285) paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "From client side, the user needs to provide a list of strings as input batch, and a list of adaptor names that each input sequence corresponds to."

    "Another advanced option is to specify adapters as `pinned` during loading. When an adapter is pinned, it is permanently assigned to one of the available GPU pool slots (as configured by `--max-loras-per-batch`) and will not be evicted from GPU memory during runtime. Instead, it remains resident until it is explicitly unloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can improve performance in scenarios where the same adapter is frequently used across requests, by avoiding repeated memory transfers and reinitialization overhead. However, since GPU pool slots are limited, pinning adapters reduces the flexibility of the system to dynamically load other adapters on demand. If too many adapters are pinned, it may lead to degraded performance, or in the most extreme case (`Number of pinned adapters == max-loras-per-batch`), halt all unpinned requests. Therefore, currently SGLang limits maximal number of pinned adapters to `max-loras-per-batch - 1` to prevent unexpected starvations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we start a server with `lora1` loaded as pinned, `lora2` and `lora3` loaded as regular (unpinned) adapters. Please note that, we intentionally specify `lora2` and `lora3` in two different formats to demonstrate that both are supported."
