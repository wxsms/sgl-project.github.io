# SGLang Frontend Language

SGLang frontend language can be used to define simple and easy prompts in a convenient, structured way.

## Launch A Server

Launch the server in your terminal and wait for it to initialize.


```python
from sglang import assistant_begin, assistant_end
from sglang import assistant, function, gen, system, user
from sglang import image
from sglang import RuntimeEndpoint
from sglang.lang.api import set_default_backend
from sglang.srt.utils import load_image
from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import print_highlight, terminate_process, wait_for_server

server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct --host 0.0.0.0 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
print(f"Server started on http://localhost:{port}")
```

    Server started on http://localhost:38179


Set the default backend. Note: Besides the local server, you may use also `OpenAI` or other API endpoints.


```python
set_default_backend(RuntimeEndpoint(f"http://localhost:{port}"))
```

    [2026-02-22 08:30:39] Endpoint '/get_model_info' is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use '/model_info' instead.


## Basic Usage

The most simple way of using SGLang frontend language is a simple question answer dialog between a user and an assistant.


```python
@function
def basic_qa(s, question):
    s += system(f"You are a helpful assistant than can answer questions.")
    s += user(question)
    s += assistant(gen("answer", max_tokens=512))
```


```python
state = basic_qa("List 3 countries and their capitals.")
print_highlight(state["answer"])
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'>Sure, here are three countries with their capitals:<br><br>1. **France** - Paris<br>2. **Australia** - Canberra<br>3. **Japan** - Tokyo</strong>


## Multi-turn Dialog

SGLang frontend language can also be used to define multi-turn dialogs.


```python
@function
def multi_turn_qa(s):
    s += system(f"You are a helpful assistant than can answer questions.")
    s += user("Please give me a list of 3 countries and their capitals.")
    s += assistant(gen("first_answer", max_tokens=512))
    s += user("Please give me another list of 3 countries and their capitals.")
    s += assistant(gen("second_answer", max_tokens=512))
    return s


state = multi_turn_qa()
print_highlight(state["first_answer"])
print_highlight(state["second_answer"])
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'>Certainly! Here is a list of three countries along with their respective capitals:<br><br>1. **France** - Paris<br>2. **Spain** - Madrid<br>3. **Italy** - Rome</strong>



<strong style='color: #00008B;'>Of course! Here is another list of three countries and their capitals:<br><br>1. **Japan** - Tokyo<br>2. **Australia** - Canberra<br>3. **Brazil** - Brasília</strong>


## Control flow

You may use any Python code within the function to define more complex control flows.


```python
@function
def tool_use(s, question):
    s += assistant(
        "To answer this question: "
        + question
        + ". I need to use a "
        + gen("tool", choices=["calculator", "search engine"])
        + ". "
    )

    if s["tool"] == "calculator":
        s += assistant("The math expression is: " + gen("expression"))
    elif s["tool"] == "search engine":
        s += assistant("The key word to search is: " + gen("word"))


state = tool_use("What is 2 * 2?")
print_highlight(state["tool"])
print_highlight(state["expression"])
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'>calculator</strong>



<strong style='color: #00008B;'>2 * 2. <br><br>When you multiply 2 by 2, the result is 4. <br><br>So, the answer is 4. <br><br>You didn't actually need a calculator for this one, but if you want to use a calculator, you can simply enter `2 * 2` and press the equal sign to get the result.</strong>


## Parallelism

Use `fork` to launch parallel prompts. Because `sgl.gen` is non-blocking, the for loop below issues two generation calls in parallel.


```python
@function
def tip_suggestion(s):
    s += assistant(
        "Here are two tips for staying healthy: "
        "1. Balanced Diet. 2. Regular Exercise.\n\n"
    )

    forks = s.fork(2)
    for i, f in enumerate(forks):
        f += assistant(
            f"Now, expand tip {i+1} into a paragraph:\n"
            + gen("detailed_tip", max_tokens=256, stop="\n\n")
        )

    s += assistant("Tip 1:" + forks[0]["detailed_tip"] + "\n")
    s += assistant("Tip 2:" + forks[1]["detailed_tip"] + "\n")
    s += assistant(
        "To summarize the above two tips, I can say:\n" + gen("summary", max_tokens=512)
    )


state = tip_suggestion()
print_highlight(state["summary"])
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'>1. **Balanced Diet**: Consuming a variety of nutrient-rich foods, including a mix of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, is essential for a healthy lifestyle. This diet supports overall health, enhances immune function, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases.<br><br>2. **Regular Exercise**: Engaging in consistent physical activity, such as aerobic, strength, and flexibility exercises, is crucial for maintaining good health. Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health, promotes weight management, enhances mood and cognitive function, and reduces the risk of various diseases.<br><br>Together, these habits foster an optimal state of well-being and can significantly improve quality of life.</strong>


## Constrained Decoding

Use `regex` to specify a regular expression as a decoding constraint. This is only supported for local models.


```python
@function
def regular_expression_gen(s):
    s += user("What is the IP address of the Google DNS servers?")
    s += assistant(
        gen(
            "answer",
            temperature=0,
            regex=r"((25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?).){3}(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)",
        )
    )


state = regular_expression_gen()
print_highlight(state["answer"])
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'>208.67.222.222</strong>


Use `regex` to define a `JSON` decoding schema.


```python
character_regex = (
    r"""\{\n"""
    + r"""    "name": "[\w\d\s]{1,16}",\n"""
    + r"""    "house": "(Gryffindor|Slytherin|Ravenclaw|Hufflepuff)",\n"""
    + r"""    "blood status": "(Pure-blood|Half-blood|Muggle-born)",\n"""
    + r"""    "occupation": "(student|teacher|auror|ministry of magic|death eater|order of the phoenix)",\n"""
    + r"""    "wand": \{\n"""
    + r"""        "wood": "[\w\d\s]{1,16}",\n"""
    + r"""        "core": "[\w\d\s]{1,16}",\n"""
    + r"""        "length": [0-9]{1,2}\.[0-9]{0,2}\n"""
    + r"""    \},\n"""
    + r"""    "alive": "(Alive|Deceased)",\n"""
    + r"""    "patronus": "[\w\d\s]{1,16}",\n"""
    + r"""    "bogart": "[\w\d\s]{1,16}"\n"""
    + r"""\}"""
)


@function
def character_gen(s, name):
    s += user(
        f"{name} is a character in Harry Potter. Please fill in the following information about this character."
    )
    s += assistant(gen("json_output", max_tokens=256, regex=character_regex))


state = character_gen("Harry Potter")
print_highlight(state["json_output"])
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{<br>    "name": "Harry Potter",<br>    "house": "Gryffindor",<br>    "blood status": "Half-blood",<br>    "occupation": "student",<br>    "wand": {<br>        "wood": "Cedar",<br>        "core": "Phoenix feather",<br>        "length": 11.5<br>    },<br>    "alive": "Alive",<br>    "patronus": "Stag",<br>    "bogart": "Screaming knight"<br>}</strong>


## Batching 

Use `run_batch` to run a batch of prompts.


```python
@function
def text_qa(s, question):
    s += user(question)
    s += assistant(gen("answer", stop="\n"))


states = text_qa.run_batch(
    [
        {"question": "What is the capital of the United Kingdom?"},
        {"question": "What is the capital of France?"},
        {"question": "What is the capital of Japan?"},
    ],
    progress_bar=True,
)

for i, state in enumerate(states):
    print_highlight(f"Answer {i+1}: {states[i]['answer']}")
```

      0%|          | 0/3 [00:00<?, ?it/s]

    100%|██████████| 3/3 [00:00<00:00, 38.33it/s]

    



<strong style='color: #00008B;'>Answer 1: The capital of the United Kingdom is London.</strong>



<strong style='color: #00008B;'>Answer 2: The capital of France is Paris.</strong>



<strong style='color: #00008B;'>Answer 3: The capital of Japan is Tokyo.</strong>


## Streaming 

Use `stream` to stream the output to the user.


```python
@function
def text_qa(s, question):
    s += user(question)
    s += assistant(gen("answer", stop="\n"))


state = text_qa.run(
    question="What is the capital of France?", temperature=0.1, stream=True
)

for out in state.text_iter():
    print(out, end="", flush=True)
```

    <|im_start|>system
    You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>
    <|im_start|>user
    What is the capital of France?<|im_end|>
    <|im_start|>assistant


    The

     capital

     of

     France

     is

     Paris

    .

    <|im_end|>


## Complex Prompts

You may use `{system|user|assistant}_{begin|end}` to define complex prompts.


```python
@function
def chat_example(s):
    s += system("You are a helpful assistant.")
    # Same as: s += s.system("You are a helpful assistant.")

    with s.user():
        s += "Question: What is the capital of France?"

    s += assistant_begin()
    s += "Answer: " + gen("answer", max_tokens=100, stop="\n")
    s += assistant_end()


state = chat_example()
print_highlight(state["answer"])
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'> The capital of France is Paris.</strong>



```python
terminate_process(server_process)
```

## Multi-modal Generation

You may use SGLang frontend language to define multi-modal prompts.
See [here](https://docs.sglang.io/supported_models/text_generation/multimodal_language_models.html) for supported models.


```python
server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --host 0.0.0.0 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
print(f"Server started on http://localhost:{port}")
```
