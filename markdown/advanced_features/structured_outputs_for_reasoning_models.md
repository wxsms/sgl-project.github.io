# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")

            "content": "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "foo",
            # convert the pydantic model to json schema
            "schema": CapitalInfo.model_json_schema(),
        },
    },
)

print_highlight(
    f"reasoing_content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content}\n\ncontent: {response.choices[0].message.content}"

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

- Always execute python code in messages that you share.
- When looking for real time information use relevant functions if available else fallback to brave_search
You have access to the following functions:
Use the function 'get_current_weather' to: Get the current weather in a given location
{tool_get_current_weather["function"]}
Use the function 'get_current_date' to: Get the current date and time for a given timezone
{tool_get_current_date["function"]}
If a you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format:
<{{start_tag}}={{function_name}}>{{parameters}}{{end_tag}}
where
start_tag => `<function`
parameters => a JSON dict with the function argument name as key and function argument value as value.
end_tag => `</function>`
Here is an example,

## Native API and SGLang Runtime (SRT)

> Note: For native API, as a work-around, you need to set `require_reasoning` argument to `True` to ensure the model will think before generating the structured output. It's not required for chat-completion API.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\n\nI\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\n\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\'ll create an object with a "name" field for the capital, a "general_information" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a "population" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\n\nI should also add a "source" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\n\nPutting it all together, I\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\n\nFinally, I\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, the user has asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. I should first identify what exactly they need. The capital of France is Paris, so I\'ll focus on that.\n\nI know that as of the latest data, Paris has a population around 2.16 million people. That\'s an approximate figure to give a clear and concise answer. I should structure the JSON properly, including the population key and the numerical value while also adding a summary sentence for clarity.\n\nHmm, maybe the user is looking for a standardized format, possibly for integration into a larger application or for data analysis. Using a JSON structure makes sense as it\'s widely used for data interchange. I\'ll make sure to format it correctly without any markdown, just plain JSON.\n\nI should also consider if the user might need updates. Populations can change over time, so it\'s worth mentioning that the figure is approximate and advises checking the latest data for accuracy.

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Alright, the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to determine which capital they're referring to. France has two capitals: Paris and Brussels. Paris is the administrative and judicial center, while Brussels is the economic and cultural hub. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume they mean Paris.
    
    Next, I should gather accurate and up-to-date information. The population of Paris is around 2 million, but it's important to note that this figure changes over time due to migration, births, and deaths. I should include the approximate current population.
    
    Additionally, the user might be interested in other notable landmarks or features of Paris. I'll mention some of the most famous ones, like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, the Arc de Triomphe, and Notre-Dame. Including these details adds value and gives a more comprehensive answer.
    
    I need to structure this information in JSON format. I'll create a key-value pair where the key is a string and the value is a string or number. For the population, it's a number, so I'll use a number type. The rest of the information will be strings.
    
    I should make sure the JSON is properly formatted, with keys in quotes and values in double quotes. Each key should be clear and descriptive. Also, I'll add a brief description to explain that the JSON contains essential information about Paris, including population and notable landmarks.
    
    Lastly, I'll review the JSON to ensure there are no syntax errors and that the information is accurate. It's important to provide a clear and helpful response, so organizing the data neatly and making it easy to read will be key.
    </think>
    
    Here is the information and population of Paris, the capital of France, in JSON format:
    
    ```json
    {
      "capital": {
        "name": "Paris",
