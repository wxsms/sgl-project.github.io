# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")
```

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")

    {'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\n\nI\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.\n\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I\'ll create an object with keys like "city", "population", and "country". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.\n\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. Also, the entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I\'ll format it properly to ensure there are no syntax errors.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I\'ll present this to the user, making sure it\'s clear and easy to understand. I don\'t think the user needs anything more detailed, but if they do, they can always ask for further information.\n\nI should also consider if there are any potential mistakes. For example, maybe I confused the capital with another city, but I\'m pretty sure Paris is correct. Also, the population number is approximate, so I\'ll note that it\'s as of 2023.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.<br><br>First, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that's straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I'm not sure of the exact number. I think it's around 2 million, but I should verify that.<br><br>I'll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see... Yes, according to the latest data, the population is approximately 2,174,300 as of 2023. That seems accurate.<br><br>Next, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON requires key-value pairs, so I'll create an object with keys like "city", "population", and "country". The city is Paris, the population is the number I found, and the country is France.<br><br>I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. Each key should be in quotes, and the values as well. Also, the entire structure should be enclosed in curly braces. I'll format it properly to ensure there are no syntax errors.<br><br>Putting it all together, the JSON object will have the city, population, and country. I'll present this to the user, making sure it's clear and easy to understand. I don't think the user needs anything more detailed, but if they do, they can always ask for further information.<br><br>I should also consider if there are any potential mistakes. For example, maybe I confused the capital with another city, but I'm pretty sure Paris is correct. Also, the population number is approximate, so I'll note that it's as of 2023. That way, the user knows the data is current.<br><br>Alright, I think I've covered everything. Time to present the JSON in a neat format.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21743000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\'s the starting point.\n\nNext, I need to find the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is a major city with a large population, but I\'m not exactly sure of the current number. I think it\'s around 2 million, but I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall that it\'s approximately 2,150,000 as of recent estimates.\n\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. I need to create a JSON object that includes the key "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the number I just thought of.\n\nI should make sure the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes for keys and string values, and commas appropriately between key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in quotes if they\'re strings, but population is a number, so it should be without quotes.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should look like this: {"capital": "Paris", "population": 2150000}. I should present this clearly so the user can easily understand and use the information.\n\nI wonder if the user needs more details, like the population figure\'s source or the exact year it was recorded. But since they didn\'t ask for that, I\'ll stick to the information requested. Maybe they just need a straightforward data structure for a program or a report.\n\nAlso, considering the user\'s request, they might be a student working on a project, or perhaps someone developing an app that requires capital cities and their populations.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, I need to figure out the information and population of the capital of France, which is Paris. I know Paris is the main city, but I\'m not exactly sure about some details. Let me think: Paris is the capital, right? I remember it\'s a pretty big and famous city. \n\nI think the population is around 10 million, but I\'m not certain. Maybe it\'s slightly more? Wait, I should be accurate. I think it\'s more like 11 million to 12 million. Hmm, but I might be mixing it up with another city. No, I\'m pretty sure Paris\'s population is in that range.\n\nAlso, Paris is not just a city; it\'s a significant cultural and political center in France. It\'s mentioned a lot in history and literature. It\'s got museums like the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower. theologians and many other notable figures have called it home. \n\nSo, to structure this in JSON, I need the key "capital" with the value "Paris," and then a nested object for the population. I should include both the estimated and approximate numbers. Since I\'m not entirely sure, I\'ll write a note at the end questioning my confidence about the exact number, just to be transparent.\n\nWait, before I finalize, let me double-check. I recall reading articles that mention Paris has a population around 12.5 million. So maybe I was a bit off earlier. I\'ll update the JSON to reflect that. Also, perhaps adding a note that the population is approximate to reflect that it might change over time.\n\nAlright, so putting it all together, I\'ll create the JSON structure with the correct population data. I should ensure all the syntax is correct, with commas and quotation marks properly placed. Let me write that out.\n</think>\n\nHere is the information and population of Paris, the capital of France, presented in JSON format with a note on the approximate population:\n\n```json\n{\n  "capital": {\n    "name": "Paris",\n    "description": "The capital of France, known for its rich history, culture, and landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum.",\n    "population": {\n      "estimated": "Approximately 12.5 million",\n      "approximate": "12,500,000"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The population figure is approximate and may vary slightly depending on the year and source.

    ===============================
    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I should identify what the capital of France is. From what I know, Paris is the capital of France. 
    
    Next, I need to find the most recent population data for Paris. I remember that the population figures can change over time, so I should look for the latest available data. I think the population was around 2 million in 2021, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check a reliable source or a recent publication to confirm the exact number. 
    
    Wait, I think I read somewhere that Paris's population is approximately 2,174,000 as of 2023. That seems a bit more recent and specific. I should verify if that's correct to ensure accuracy. 
    
    Now, regarding the format, the user specifically asked for JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So, I'll structure the information into a JSON object with the appropriate key-value pairs. 
    
    I should include at least two keys: "capital" and "population". The "capital" key will hold the name of the city, which is Paris. The "population" key will hold the number, which I believe is 2,174,000. 
    
    Wait, but sometimes populations can fluctuate, so I should double-check that number. Maybe I can recall that Paris has grown a bit since 2020, so 2.17 million seems reasonable. 
    
    Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this:
    
    {
      "capital": "Paris",
      "population": 2174000
    }
    
    I think that's straightforward. The user probably wants a simple, clear response without any extra fluff. They might be using this data for a project or a presentation, so accuracy is key. 
    
    I should make sure to present the information clearly and concisely. No need for additional fields unless the user specifies more details, which they didn't in this case. 
    
    So, the final answer should be the JSON object with the capital and population as mentioned. I'll present it neatly, perhaps with line breaks for readability, but as per the user's initial example, it seems they just want the JSON without any extra text.
    </think>
    
    ```json
    {
      "capital": "Paris",
      "population": 2174000
    }
    ```
