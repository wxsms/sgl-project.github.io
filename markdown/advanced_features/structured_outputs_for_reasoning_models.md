# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}")
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")
```

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")


response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B",
    messages=[

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "foo",
            # convert the pydantic model to json schema
            "schema": CapitalInfo.model_json_schema(),
        },
    },
)

print_highlight(
    f"reasoing_content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content}\n\ncontent: {response.choices[0].message.content}"
)
```

Maybe around 20 million? I'm not certain, though. I should probably double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I think I heard somewhere that Paris has a population over 21 million. Maybe 21.6 million? I'm not sure if that's accurate. I should look up the latest data to confirm. Also, I wonder if the population includes just the city proper or the entire metropolitan area. I think sometimes population counts include the broader area, so maybe that's why the number is higher. <br><br>I should make sure to present this information in JSON format as the user requested. So, the key would be "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the number. I need to decide whether to include the metropolitan area or just the city limits. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the metropolitan area population, which I think is around 21.6 million. <br><br>I should also consider the source of this information to ensure accuracy. Maybe the World Bank or recent census data. I recall that the population has been growing steadily, so 21.6 million seems reasonable. I don't think it's too high or too low. <br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have two keys: "capital" and "population". The value for "capital" is "Paris", and "population" is 21600000. I should format it correctly with proper syntax, using quotes and commas where necessary. <br><br>I think that's all. I just need to make sure the information is accurate and present it in the required format.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>

The official capital of France is Paris, so that's correct. Now, for the population, I think it's a bit tricky because population numbers can change yearly. I believe the latest data from 2021 puts the population at approximately 21.6 million. But I'm not 100% sure if that's accurate or if it's an average. Maybe it's around 21.5 million?

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

    {'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\'s straightforward. \n\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\'s over 3 million, but I\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \n\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \n\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\'ll create an object with keys like "city", "population", and maybe "country" since the user mentioned France. \n\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\'ll format this into a JSON object. \n\nI also need to present this in a way that\'s easy to read, so I\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\'s valid, but since I\'m just writing it out, I\'ll assume it\'s correct based on my knowledge. \n\nI think that\'s all.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me first figure out what exactly they need. They want the information about the capital, which is Paris, and specifically its population. \n\nI should start by confirming that Paris is indeed the capital and then look up the latest population figures. I remember that population numbers can change due to births, deaths, and migration. I think the most recent data is from 2021, which was released at the end of the year. \n\nNow, for the structure, they asked for JSON. That means I need to organize the information neatly in key-value pairs. Let me include some relevant details like city name, population as an integer, population growth rate, and maybe some key highlights like the diversity of the population, cultural significance, and a notable landmark. \n\nI wonder why the user specifically asked for JSON. Maybe they\'re integrating this data into an application or website. Ensuring accurate and well-formatted JSON is important for their use case. I\'ll make sure all the numbers are up to date and the information is concise yet comprehensive.\n\nAlso, I should present the JSON in a clear manner, maybe with pretty formatting so it\'s easier to read. Maybe they\'ll want to copy and paste it, so formatting matters to them. I should double-check the population numbers to avoid any mistakes. It\'s important to provide reliable and current data, especially for something as sensitive as population information.\n\nLastly, I should keep the JSON structure simple. Not too complicated, just enough to cover the essentials. That way, the user can easily extract the information they need without having to parse too much.\n</think>\n\nCertainly!

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Alright, the user is asking for the capital of France and its population in JSON format. I need to provide accurate information.
    
    First, I know that Paris is the capital of France. That's pretty straightforward.
    
    Next, I should look up the latest population data for Paris. I remember that the population numbers can vary slightly each year, so it's best to use the most recent estimate. From what I recall, around 2020, Paris had a population of about 2,150,000. I should verify that to make sure it's current, maybe check a recent census or official stats.
    
    I should structure this information neatly in JSON format. That means using key-value pairs. The keys would be "capital" and "population", with their respective values. I'll make sure the numbers are correctly formatted, using commas where necessary.
    
    Also, I should present this in a clear and concise manner, as the user requested. Maybe offer to provide more details if they need further information. That way, I'm being helpful and open to assisting them further.
    
    Putting it all together, I'll format the JSON correctly, ensuring that the keys and values are properly enclosed in quotes and separated by commas. I'll double-check the population number to confirm its accuracy before finalizing the response.
    
    Finally, I'll send the JSON data back to the user and let them know they can ask for more info if needed. That should cover everything the user requested.
    </think>
    
    Here is the information in JSON format:
    
    ```json
    {
      "capital": "Paris",
      "population": 2150000
    }
    ```



```python
llm.shutdown()
