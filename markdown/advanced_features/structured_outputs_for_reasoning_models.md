# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")


response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "foo",
            # convert the pydantic model to json schema
            "schema": CapitalInfo.model_json_schema(),
        },
    },
)

print_highlight(
    f"reasoing_content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content}\n\ncontent: {response.choices[0].message.content}"
)
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. I know that the capital of France is Paris, but I'm not exactly sure about the current population numbers. I remember that Paris is a very big city, but I think it's not the largest in the world. Maybe around 20 million? I'm not certain, though. I should probably double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I think I heard somewhere that Paris has a population over 21 million. Maybe 21.6 million? I'm not sure if that's accurate. I should look up the latest data to confirm. Also, I wonder if the population includes just the city proper or the entire metropolitan area. I think sometimes population counts include the broader area, so maybe that's why the number is higher. <br><br>I should make sure to present this information in JSON format as the user requested. So, the key would be "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the number. I need to decide whether to include the metropolitan area or just the city limits. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the metropolitan area population, which I think is around 21.6 million. <br><br>I should also consider the source of this information to ensure accuracy. Maybe the World Bank or recent census data. I recall that the population has been growing steadily, so 21.6 million seems reasonable. I don't think it's too high or too low. <br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have two keys: "capital" and "population". The value for "capital" is "Paris", and "population" is 21600000. I should format it correctly with proper syntax, using quotes and commas where necessary. <br><br>I think that's all. I just need to make sure the information is accurate and present it in the required format.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>


**JSON Schema Directly**



```python

Also, I should make sure that Paris is indeed the capital and not another city like Lyon or Marseille.<br><br>I'm pretty confident that Paris is the capital, but just to be thorough, I'll double-check. The official capital of France is Paris, so that's correct. Now, for the population, I think it's a bit tricky because population numbers can change yearly. I believe the latest data from 2021 puts the population at approximately 21.6 million. But I'm not 100% sure if that's accurate or if it's an average. Maybe it's around 21.5 million? I should present it as an estimate since exact numbers can vary.<br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have the key "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the estimated number. I'll format it properly, making sure the syntax is correct with commas and quotes. I should also mention that the population is an estimate based on the latest available data to avoid any confusion.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

The user mentioned two functions: get_current_weather and get_current_date. <br><br>I'll start with get_current_date because that's part of their request. The function requires a timezone parameter. Since they're in New York, I can use 'America/New_York' as the value.

This function needs city, state, and unit. The city is New York, the state is NY, and they probably want Fahrenheit since it's common in the US. So the parameters will be {'city': 'New York', 'state': 'NY', 'unit': 'fahrenheit'}. The function call will be <function=get_current_weather>{"city": "New York", "state": "NY", "unit": "fahrenheit"}}</function>.<br><br>I should make sure to call each function separately, as per the instructions, and include the necessary parameters. Also, I need to format each function call on a new line with the correct tags and parameters in JSON format.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll list both function calls with their respective parameters to provide the user with both the date/time and weather information.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{"timezone": "America/New_York"}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{"city": "New York", "state": "NY", "unit": "fahrenheit"}</function></strong>


## Native API and SGLang Runtime (SRT)

> Note: For native API, as a work-around, you need to set `require_reasoning` argument to `True` to ensure the model will think before generating the structured output. It's not required for chat-completion API.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\n\nI\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\n\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\'ll create an object with a "name" field for the capital, a "general_information" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a "population" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\n\nI should also add a "source" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\n\nPutting it all together, I\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\n\nFinally, I\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to find out the information and population of the capital of France, which is Paris. Let me think about what I know about Paris. I\'ve heard it\'s the most visited city in the world and has a huge population. But I should probably confirm some details.\n\nFirst, Paris\'s coordinates. I know it\'s in France, so the country is definitely France, and I think the area code is something around 75. For latitude and longitude, I remember it\'s somewhere around 48 degrees north and 2 degrees east. But wait, I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe it\'s better to double-check, but since I\'m roleplaying as someone just thinking through this, I\'ll proceed with what I remember: approximately 48.8566° N, 2.3522° E.\n\nNext, elevation. I recall that Paris is situated on a hill called Les Antilles, so it should have a elevation above sea level. I think it\'s around 25 meters, but I might be mixing it up with another city. I\'ll go with 25 meters for now.\n\nPopulation density is a bit tricky. Paris is super dense because it\'s a major city. I remember reading that the population is over 3 million. Maybe around 3.6 million. But how large is the metropolitan area? I think it\'s much bigger, like over a 10 million. I think it\'s about 10,556,000 people. The land area I\'ll have to estimate. France\'s total area is about 55,000 km², but Paris is only a small part of it. Maybe around 10 km², so 10 square kilometers.\n\nDemographics-wise, Paris is mostly French nationals. I think the percentage is around 97%, and 3% are non-Europeans. That sounds about right.\n\nNow, Paris has a Time Zone. I believe it observes Central European Time (CET), which is UTC+1. And yes, daylight saving time is used in Paris.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure should include all these details: country, region, coordinates, elevation, population, population density, metropolitan area population, land area, demographics, and time zone.\n\nWait, the population figure I used was 2019, but the latest data might have changed. Let me see, as of 2023, Paris\'s population is around 2.2 million according to some sources, but that seems low. Wait, maybe I got confused with the metropolitan area. Let me correct that. Paris\'s metropolitan area populations vary, perhaps in the mid-10s of millions. Maybe closer to 11 million. I think I confused it with another city.\n\nOkay, adjusting that: metropolitan area population around 11,326,000. That feels more accurate. So, I\'ll correct that in my answer.\n\nAlso, checking the elevation again, since I was unsure. Paris\'s elevation is higher than I thought. Maybe 232 meters above sea level because it\'s on a hill called Les Antilles. That sounds more accurate. So, I\'ll update the elevation to 232 meters.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON should reflect these corrected numbers. Population density would then be calculated based on the metropolitan area. So, 11,326,000 divided by 10 km² would give a density around 1,132,600 per km², which seems extremely high but correct for a major city.\n\nOkay, I think that covers it. Now, I\'ll structure this in JSON format as requested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  "capital": {\n    "country": "France",\n    "region": "Ile de France",\n    "coordinates": {\n      "latitude":

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Okay, the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. So first, I need to figure out who the user is and what they need. They might be a student working on a project or maybe someone setting up a database. 
    
    I should make sure the JSON structure is clear and properly formatted. The key points they need are the city's name, country, population, and maybe some other relevant details. Population can vary, so I should get the most recent data. I think as of 2023, Paris has a population around 2 million.
    
    I need to present this information in a JSON format. Let me structure it with "City": "Paris", "Country": "France", "Population": 2000000, and a note about the population figure being approximate. That should cover their needs effectively.
    </think>
    
    Here is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:
    
    ```json
    {
      "City": "Paris",
      "Country": "France",
      "Population": 2000000 // Population of Paris (approximate figure)
    }
    ```
    
    Note: The population figure is approximate and may vary depending on the source and year of data.
