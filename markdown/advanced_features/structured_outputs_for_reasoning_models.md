# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")

            "content": "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "foo",
            # convert the pydantic model to json schema
            "schema": CapitalInfo.model_json_schema(),
        },
    },
)

print_highlight(
    f"reasoing_content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content}\n\ncontent: {response.choices[0].message.content}"

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

- Always execute python code in messages that you share.
- When looking for real time information use relevant functions if available else fallback to brave_search
You have access to the following functions:
Use the function 'get_current_weather' to: Get the current weather in a given location
{tool_get_current_weather["function"]}
Use the function 'get_current_date' to: Get the current date and time for a given timezone
{tool_get_current_date["function"]}
If a you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format:

## Native API and SGLang Runtime (SRT)

> Note: For native API, as a work-around, you need to set `require_reasoning` argument to `True` to ensure the model will think before generating the structured output. It's not required for chat-completion API.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\n\nI\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\n\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\'ll create an object with a "name" field for the capital, a "general_information" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a "population" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\n\nI should also add a "source" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\n\nPutting it all together, I\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\n\nFinally, I\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user is asking for the capital of France along with its population, but they specifically want the information in JSON format. Okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what exactly the user is looking for. They might just need a quick data point, maybe for a project or a quick reference. They want it structured in JSON, which suggests they might be integrating this data into another application or processing it programmatically.\n\nNow, the capital of France is straightforward—it\'s Paris. But I should verify the population figure to make sure it\'s up-to-date. Population numbers can change every year due to births, deaths, and migration. I need to provide the most recent estimate available, probably from 2023 or 2022 as of the last update.\n\nI should also consider why they phrased their question as "give me the information and population." Maybe they\'re looking for a combining of facts in one go rather than separate queries. So, it\'s efficient if I present it within a single JSON object.\n\nBreaking it down, the JSON structure would have a key "capital" with the name of the city and another key "population" with the number. I need to make sure the formatting is correct—commas in the right places, proper key names in quotes, and the data types correct.\n\nAlso, I should note that population figures can vary slightly based on the source and the year. It\'s good practice to mention that the number is an estimate as it\'s subject to change. This adds credibility to the response and sets clear expectations about the data\'s accuracy.\n\nThinking about possible reasons for needing this info: Maybe the user is a student working on a geography project, a researcher compiling data, or someone integrating this into an app. Either way, providing the facts accurately and in the requested format is key.\n\nI should ensure that the JSON is well-formatted, perhaps using proper indentation for readability.

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.
    
    First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's a fact I remember from history class. Now, I need to find the population of Paris. I think the population numbers can vary because sometimes they include just the city limits and other times they include the entire metropolitan area. I should check both to be accurate.
    
    I recall that Paris is one of the most populous cities in the world, but I'm not sure of the exact number. Maybe around 2 million? Wait, that seems low. I think it's more than that. I should look it up to be sure. Oh right, I remember hearing that Paris has over 2.1 million residents. But to get precise data, I should probably refer to a reliable source like the latest census or a reputable statistical database.
    
    Wait, the user asked for the population in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to structure data. So I need to create a JSON object that includes the key information about Paris. The main points would be the name of the city, its status as the capital, the country it's in, and its population.
    
    I should make sure the JSON is correctly formatted. Each key should be in double quotes, and the values can be numbers or strings. Also, the numbers should have commas and periods in the right places to avoid syntax errors.
    
    I think the user is probably looking for a simple data structure that's easy to read and use, maybe for a program or a report. They might not just want a single number but some context as well, so including the full name of the city makes sense.
    
    Let me put this all together. The JSON object should have keys like "name," "capital," "country," and "population." The population value should be a number. I should double-check the current population to ensure accuracy. As of the latest data I can recall, Paris has approximately 2,155,000 residents. That's about 2.155 million.
    
    Wait, I should verify if that's the metropolitan area or just the city proper. Sometimes, the metropolitan area includes a larger population. But since the user didn't specify, I'll assume it's the city proper. Also, I should note that population figures can change over time due to various factors like migration, births, and deaths.
    
    Alright, I think I have all the information I need. Now, I'll format it into a JSON object, making sure the syntax is correct and that all the data is accurately represented. I'll include the population as a number without commas for consistency, so 2155000.
    
    I should also mention in the response that this population figure is approximate and can change, just in case the user needs the most up-to-date information. But for now, providing a clear and concise JSON response should meet the user's needs.
    </think>
    
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Paris",
      "capital": true,
      "country": "France",
      "population": 2155000
    }
    ```
    
    This JSON object provides the information about the capital of France, which is Paris. The population figure is approximate and may vary depending on the source and the time of measurement.
