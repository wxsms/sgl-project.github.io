# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")
```

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

- Always execute python code in messages that you share.
- When looking for real time information use relevant functions if available else fallback to brave_search
You have access to the following functions:
Use the function 'get_current_weather' to: Get the current weather in a given location
{tool_get_current_weather["function"]}
Use the function 'get_current_date' to: Get the current date and time for a given timezone
{tool_get_current_date["function"]}
If a you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format:
<{{start_tag}}={{function_name}}>{{parameters}}{{end_tag}}
where
start_tag => `<function`
parameters => a JSON dict with the function argument name as key and function argument value as value.
end_tag => `</function>`

## Native API and SGLang Runtime (SRT)

> Note: For native API, as a work-around, you need to set `require_reasoning` argument to `True` to ensure the model will think before generating the structured output. It's not required for chat-completion API.

I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\n\nI\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census.

I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\n\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\'ll create an object with a "name" field for the capital, a "general_information" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a "population" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\n\nI should also add a "source" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\n\nPutting it all together, I\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, I know that the capital is Paris. Let me think about the population. I believe it\'s around 2 million, but wait, isn\'t there a metropolitan area? Oh right, sometimes people include the metro area, which is about 8 million. The user probably wants the correct figure here. Also, Paris has a voting population, including those from DOM and DHZ. I\'m a bit fuzzy on the exact number, but it\'s something like 2.1 million. \n\nI should structure this as a JSON object. So, the key would be "capital" and the value would be another object containing "city", "population", and "voting_population". It makes the data easy to parse. Wait, should I include all that info or just the population? The query said population of the capital, so maybe the main point is the population. But providing more context could be helpful. \n\nI think the user is probably working on a project that requires structured data. JSON is a standard format, so it\'s likely they want it for that purpose. They might also appreciate a bit of context along with the numbers. I\'ll make sure to format it neatly with proper labels so it\'s clear and easy to integrate into their work. Just need to double-check the numbers to make sure I have them right, especially the population figures for the city and voting population. Yeah, I\'m pretty confident with those numbers. \n\nAlright, time to put it all together in JSON. Starting with the main capital, then adding the details. That should cover what the user is looking for.

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify the capital of France, which is straightforward—Paris. 
    
    Next, I should gather accurate data about Paris's population. I recall that the population figures can vary each year due to births, deaths, and migration. I think the latest estimates around 2023 put it somewhere between 2 million and 3 million. To be precise, I should check a reliable source or database to confirm the exact number. 
    
    I also need to include other relevant information about the city, such as its region. Paris is part of Île-de-France, which is one of the most populous regions in France. Including this context might be helpful for the user, providing a bit more depth about Paris's significance.
    
    Now, structuring this into JSON format. I'll need to create a key-value pair where the key is "capital" and the value is another JSON object containing the population and region details. It's important to ensure the JSON is correctly formatted with proper syntax—commas in the right places, colons, and correct brackets. 
    
    I should also make sure that the population number is up-to-date. Sometimes, the population can change, so it's best to verify the current estimate. I remember reading that Paris is one of the densest cities in the world, so that's an interesting fact to include as well.
    
    Putting it all together, the JSON structure will have the "capital" key with the city name, and inside that, the population and region. I'll format it neatly, probably using proper indentation for readability, even though JSON doesn't require it. 
    
    Finally, I'll present this in a clear and concise manner, making sure the response is helpful and meets the user's request accurately.
    </think>
    
    Here is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:
    
    ```json
    {
      "capital": {
        "name": "Paris",
        "population": 2153000,
        "region": "Île-de-France"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    This JSON object contains the following information:
    - The name of the capital city: Paris
    - The population of Paris (as of the latest estimate): approximately 2,153,000
    - The region in which Paris is located: Île-de-France
