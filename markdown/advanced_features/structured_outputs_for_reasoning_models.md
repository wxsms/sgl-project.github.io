# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}")
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")
```

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")

            "content": "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "foo",
            # convert the pydantic model to json schema
            "schema": CapitalInfo.model_json_schema(),
        },
    },
)

print_highlight(
    f"reasoing_content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content}\n\ncontent: {response.choices[0].message.content}"
)

Maybe around 20 million? I'm not certain, though. I should probably double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I think I heard somewhere that Paris has a population over 21 million. Maybe 21.6 million? I'm not sure if that's accurate. I should look up the latest data to confirm. Also, I wonder if the population includes just the city proper or the entire metropolitan area. I think sometimes population counts include the broader area, so maybe that's why the number is higher. <br><br>I should make sure to present this information in JSON format as the user requested. So, the key would be "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the number. I need to decide whether to include the metropolitan area or just the city limits. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the metropolitan area population, which I think is around 21.6 million. <br><br>I should also consider the source of this information to ensure accuracy. Maybe the World Bank or recent census data. I recall that the population has been growing steadily, so 21.6 million seems reasonable. I don't think it's too high or too low. <br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have two keys: "capital" and "population". The value for "capital" is "Paris", and "population" is 21600000. I should format it correctly with proper syntax, using quotes and commas where necessary. <br><br>I think that's all. I just need to make sure the information is accurate and present it in the required format.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

> Note: For native API, as a work-around, you need to set `require_reasoning` argument to `True` to ensure the model will think before generating the structured output. It's not required for chat-completion API.

    {'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\'s straightforward. \n\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\'s over 3 million, but I\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \n\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \n\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\'ll create an object with keys like "city", "population", and maybe "country" since the user mentioned France. \n\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\'ll format this into a JSON object. \n\nI also need to present this in a way that\'s easy to read, so I\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\'s valid, but since I\'m just writing it out, I\'ll assume it\'s correct based on my knowledge. \n\nI think that\'s all.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Well, first, I need to figure out which city is the capital of France. I\'m pretty sure it\'s Paris. \n\nNow, I have to recall or look up the population of Paris. I remember that Paris is the most populated city in France, but I\'m not exactly sure about the current population number. I think it\'s over 3 million, maybe around 3.5 million? \n\nI should consider if this information is up to date. Populations can change every year due to births, deaths, and migration. If I checked today, 2023, the population might have been 3,508,072. That number rings a bell, but I should verify it just to be safe. Maybe I can remember that in recent years, Paris has been slightly growing, so 3.5 million is a reasonable estimate. \n\nWait, I should double-check the exact current population. Hmm, as of 2023, Paris does have a population of about 3.508 million. Okay, so that\'s accurate. \n\nNow, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON requires the use of keys and values within curly braces. So the structure should have a key for "capital" which is "Paris" and a key for "population" with that number. \n\nI should make sure the numbers are formatted correctly, using commas appropriately inside the JSON. It\'s also good practice to include a quotation mark around the city name and the population number to ensure the JSON is valid and can be parsed correctly. \n\nIs there anything else the user might need? They just asked for the information, so probably that\'s all.

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Alright, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.
    
    First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital of France. Okay, so that's straightforward.
    
    Next, the user wants the population. I should check the most recent data. I remember that the population of Paris is around 2 million. But I should make sure it's up-to-date. Maybe it's a bit more now, considering growth. Let me think, I believe it's approximately 2,170,000 as of 2023.
    
    Now, they specifically asked for JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. So I need to structure this into a JSON object.
    
    I'll start with the key "capital" and assign the value "Paris". Then another key "population" with the number I just thought of. To make it clear, I'll format the number with commas, so it's 2,170,000.
    
    Putting it all together, the JSON should look like this:
    
    {
      "capital": "Paris",
      "population": 2170000
    }
    
    I should double-check to ensure there are no typos and that the JSON is correctly formatted. Also, maybe add a comment to note that the population figure is approximate for 2023. That way, the user knows the information might change over time.
    
    So, the final answer should present the data clearly in JSON, making it easy for the user to understand and use if they need to parse it programmatically.
    </think>
    
    ```json
    {
      "capital": "Paris",
      "population": 2170000
    }
    ```
