# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}")
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")
```

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")

    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B",

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "foo",
            # convert the pydantic model to json schema
            "schema": CapitalInfo.model_json_schema(),
        },
    },
)

print_highlight(
    f"reasoing_content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content}\n\ncontent: {response.choices[0].message.content}"
)
```

I know that the capital of France is Paris, but I'm not exactly sure about the current population numbers. I remember that Paris is a very big city, but I think it's not the largest in the world. Maybe around 20 million? I'm not certain, though. I should probably double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I think I heard somewhere that Paris has a population over 21 million. Maybe 21.6 million? I'm not sure if that's accurate. I should look up the latest data to confirm. Also, I wonder if the population includes just the city proper or the entire metropolitan area. I think sometimes population counts include the broader area, so maybe that's why the number is higher. <br><br>I should make sure to present this information in JSON format as the user requested. So, the key would be "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the number. I need to decide whether to include the metropolitan area or just the city limits. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the metropolitan area population, which I think is around 21.6 million. <br><br>I should also consider the source of this information to ensure accuracy. Maybe the World Bank or recent census data. I recall that the population has been growing steadily, so 21.6 million seems reasonable. I don't think it's too high or too low. <br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have two keys: "capital" and "population". The value for "capital" is "Paris", and "population" is 21600000. I should format it correctly with proper syntax, using quotes and commas where necessary. <br><br>I think that's all. I just need to make sure the information is accurate and present it in the required format.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>


**JSON Schema Directly**

The official capital of France is Paris, so that's correct. Now, for the population, I think it's a bit tricky because population numbers can change yearly.

I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

    {'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down. First, I need to identify what the capital of France is. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\'s straightforward. \n\nNext, I need to find the population. I remember that Paris is a major city, so its population is quite large. I think it\'s over 3 million, but I\'m not exactly sure of the exact number. Maybe I should double-check that. \n\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year. The user didn\'t specify a particular year, so I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \n\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\'ll create an object with keys like "city", "population", and maybe "country" since the user mentioned France. \n\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\'ll format this into a JSON object. \n\nI also need to present this in a way that\'s easy to read, so I\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places. No trailing commas to avoid errors. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should look something like this: a dictionary with the keys and the corresponding values. I\'ll make sure to test it to ensure it\'s valid, but since I\'m just writing it out, I\'ll assume it\'s correct based on my knowledge. \n\nI think that\'s all.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, first, I need to determine what JSON is. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, right? It\'s a way to represent data structures in a readable format, often used on the web.\n\nOkay, but for this, I need the capital of France. That\'s straightforward; the capital of France is Paris. Now, what information about Paris are they asking for? They didn\'t specify, but since they just mentioned "information," I have to assume it refers to basic facts, and population is a key part of that.\n\nSo, I should look up the current population of Paris. Wait, what\'s the latest available data? As of now, Paris is the most populous city in France. Let me recall or estimate. I think it\'s around 2 million people. But to be accurate, I should check the exact number. I\'ll search online for the latest population statistics for Paris.\n\nUpon checking, Paris has a population of approximately 2,173,087 as of 2023. That\'s the official figure from the National Institute of Statistics (INSEE). So, I should include that in the JSON response. \n\nWhat about other information? Since they didn\'t specify, maybe the city\'s name is Paris, country is France, and perhaps some key facts like it\'s the capital. So, the JSON should have a "capital" field indicating Paris, "country" as France, and "population" as the number I found.\n\nLet me structure it. The data should be a JSON object with keys: "capital", "country", and "population". Make sure the population value is a number. Also, ensure the JSON is valid. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON would look like {"capital": "Paris", "country": "France", "population": 2173087}. That should meet the user\'s request.\n\nI should also consider any possible follow-up questions. Maybe the user is a student working on a project, or perhaps they\'re designing a city app. Ensuring the information is reliable and up-to-date is important. \n\nAs the AI, I should probably stick to the facts and avoid any uncertainties.

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. First, I need to figure out who the user is and what they need. They're probably looking for a structured data format, which suggests they might be integrating this data into another application or website. Maybe they're a developer or someone working on a project that requires population data.
    
    I should consider what exactly the user wants. The capital is Paris, so I'll need its population. I remember that the population figures change over time due to births, deaths, and migration. I'll have to find the most recent estimate. I think the latest data I have is from 2022, where Paris had around 2,205,000 residents. That number can vary, so I should note that it's an approximate figure.
    
    Next, I need to structure this in JSON. JSON is useful because it's easy to parse and use in various programming languages. The user probably wants a neat, organized data structure. I'll create a top-level object with keys like "capital" and "population". Under "capital", I'll include another object with its name and region. For "population", I'll include the number and a note about it being an approximate figure.
    
    I should also mention that the population can change, so the user is aware that the number might not be static. Maybe they'll need the data updated, so it's good to inform them about that. Also, I'll offer to provide more details if they need them, showing that I'm open to further assistance.
    
    Overall, I need to present the information clearly and concisely, making sure it's accurate and useful for whatever the user's application needs. I'll double-check the population number to ensure it's current and correct to avoid any confusion or inaccuracies.
    </think>
    
    Here is the information about the capital of France, Paris, in JSON format:
    
    ```json
    {
      "capital": {
        "name": "Paris",
        "region": "Ile-de-France"
      },
      "population": {
        "number": 2205000,
        "note": "Population figures may vary slightly depending on the source and year of compilation."
      }
    }
    ```
    
    This JSON structure contains the name of the capital, its region, and its population. The population number is approximate and may change over time. Let me know if you need further details!
