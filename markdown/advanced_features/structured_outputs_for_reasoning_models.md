# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")
```

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")

            "content": "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "foo",
            # convert the pydantic model to json schema
            "schema": CapitalInfo.model_json_schema(),
        },
    },
)

print_highlight(
    f"reasoing_content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content}\n\ncontent: {response.choices[0].message.content}"

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

- Always execute python code in messages that you share.
- When looking for real time information use relevant functions if available else fallback to brave_search
You have access to the following functions:
Use the function 'get_current_weather' to: Get the current weather in a given location
{tool_get_current_weather["function"]}
Use the function 'get_current_date' to: Get the current date and time for a given timezone
{tool_get_current_date["function"]}
If a you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format:
<{{start_tag}}={{function_name}}>{{parameters}}{{end_tag}}
where
start_tag => `<function`

The user mentioned being in New York, which is NY. So the city is 'New York' and the state is 'NY'. The unit isn't specified, so I'll default to Celsius. The function call will be <function=weather>{{"city": "New York", "state": "NY", "unit": "celsius"}}</function>.<br><br>Now, I should present both results clearly. I'll list them separately so the user can easily see each piece of information. I'll make sure to include the function calls with the correct parameters and format them as per the instructions.<br><br>I also need to remember to add sources when I use search results, but since these are direct function calls with no external data, I don't need to cite any sources here.<br><br>Putting it all together, I'll structure the response with each function call on its own line, ensuring clarity and correctness.<br><br><br>content: <function=get_current_date>{  <br>  "timezone": "America/New_York"  <br>}</function>  <br><function=get_current_weather>{  <br>  "city": "New York",  <br>  "state": "NY",  <br>  "unit": "celsius"  <br>}</function></strong>


## Native API and SGLang Runtime (SRT)

> Note: For native API, as a work-around, you need to set `require_reasoning` argument to `True` to ensure the model will think before generating the structured output. It's not required for chat-completion API.

I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\n\nI\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census.

I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\n\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\'ll create an object with a "name" field for the capital, a "general_information" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a "population" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\n\nI should also add a "source" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\n\nPutting it all together, I\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so I need to figure out the information and population of the capital of France. Alright, let me start by understanding the question. It says, "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format." \n\nFirst, I should identify the capital of France. I\'m pretty sure it\'s Paris, but I remember hearing once that it\'s actually moving the capital somewhere else. Wait, is that true? I think it was a proposed plan, but it didn\'t happen. So the current capital remains Paris. Okay, so Paris is the capital now.\n\nNext, I need to find out the population of Paris. I know that major cities tend to have huge populations, so Paris must be one of the most populous. I think it\'s over 30 million. Let me see, maybe around 3,500,000? I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe I should double-check this number because it\'s important to get it right.\n\nNow, thinking about how to present this information. The user wants a JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it\'s a way to structure data. So I\'ll need to create a JSON object that includes the key information about Paris, such as its location, nickname, geological features, and population. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned "information," so maybe I should include more details. For example, the historical significance of Paris, like it being the birthplace of romanticism or the Eiffel Tower. Maybe the University of Paris and the Sorbonne as notable institutions. Also, I should include languages spoken there, major attractions like the Louvre, Napoleon\'s statue in gardens, and mention of Paris being the capital.\n\nNow, structuring this into a JSON format. I\'ll need to have an "info" key, and under that, multiple entries for each category, like location, nickname, etc. Each subkey under "info" can be a list of strings or maybe more structured data. Since the user is asking for information, it\'s likely they want a simple list without nested objects.\n\nAlso, considering the population, is the number accurate up to 2023? I think the population might have increased since the last census in 2020. So maybe it\'s around 3,100,000. But to be safe, maybe I should state that the population can vary and provide the most recent data.\n\nPutting it all together, I\'ll create a JSON object with an "info" key containing a "capital" subkey, which has various pieces of information under it, like location, nickname, geological details, and so on. Then, under a "population" key, I\'ll include the number in a neat format with commas separating the digits for readability.\n\nWait, should I include more details? The problem statement says "information and population," but it might be better to ensure that all key points are covered in the JSON. Maybe I should list each piece of information clearly under the "info" section.\n\nAlso, am I supposed to format the JSON correctly? Like, using proper commas and brackets? Yes, because JSON syntax is strict. Each key-value pair should be properly separated by commas, and strings should be in double quotes.\n\nSo, to summarize, the JSON should have a top-level key "info" with a key "capital" containing an array of information about Paris, and another key "population" with the number. I need to make sure the JSON is valid and that the population number is as accurate as possible.\n\nWait, should the population number be a static value or dynamic? Since it\'s a JSON structure, I might just use the exact number I recall, but it\'s important to note that population figures change over time. Maybe the user can update it if needed.\n\nNow, considering the structure, maybe it\'s better to have the "population" as a separate key, not nested. So the JSON would look something like:\n\n{\n  "info": {\n    "capital": [\n      "Name",\n      "Nickname",\n      "Location",\n      ...\n    ],\n    "population": {\n      "current": 3100000,\n      "approx": "3.1 million"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHmm, but maybe the "population" should just be a number. Yeah, perhaps that\'s simpler. So:\n\n{\n  "info": {\n    "capital": {\n      "name": "Paris",\n      "official_name": "The City of Love and Light",\n      "geographical_features": "Surrounded by the Seine River, the Etrx, and Montmartre.",\n      "historical_significance": ["Birthplace of Romanticism", "Home to the Eiffel Tower", "Cradle of French culture"],\n      "languages": ["French", "Spanish", "Italian"],\n      "major_attractions": ["Louvre Museum", "Napoleon\'s Last Post in the Jardin des Tuileries", "Gardens of Tuileries and Conti"],\n      "“(” Requirements for becoming Parisian): ["Bridal Veil", "Wearing a Name reflectingGPS of Birthplace", "Respecting the Parisian Code of Politeness"],\n      "“(” France\'s First nailed capital): true,\n      "“(” Alternative capital options): [" Lyons", "Lyon"],\n      "“(” French Gr첧 Lockdownוכיח Paris as a Capital": true\n    },\n    "population": {\n      "current": 3150000,\n      "approx": 3.15 million,\n      "growth_rate": "1.5% annually"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWait, maybe that\'s too detailed and cluttered. The user probably wants a simplified version without all the subkeys. So perhaps the "population" key can just be an integer, and the rest of the info can be under "capital".\n\nTherefore, the final JSON might look like:\n\n{\n  "info": {\n    "capital": {\n      "name": "Paris",\n      "official_name": "The City of Light and Love",\n      "geographical_info": "Surrounded by the Seine River, the Étang de la Fontaine, and Montmartre.",\n      "istinguishing_features": ["Bridal Veil", "Wearing a Name reflecting one\'sBirthplace", "Respecting the Parisian Code of Politeness"],\n      "historicalnotoriety": ["Birthplace of Romanticism", "Home to the Eiffel Tower", "Cradle of French culture"],\n      "current_population": 3150000,\n      "growth": " growing at 1.5% annually",\n      "official_title": "The official capital of France",\n      "alternative_caps": ["Lyons", "Lyon"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWait, that might be overly detailed again. Maybe it\'s better to have the population under a separate section, as in:\n\n{\n  "capital": {\n    "name": "Paris",\n    "official_name": "The City of Light and Love",\n    "geographical_info": "Surrounded by the Seine, Étang de la Fontaine, and Montmartre.",\n    "istinguishing Features": ["Bridal Veil", "Wearing a Name reflecting Birthplace", "Respecting the Parisian Code of Politeness"],\n    "historicalnotoriety": ["Birthplace of Romanticism", "Home to the Eiffel Tower", "Cradle of French culture"],\n    "current_population": 3150000,\n    "growth": "1.5% annually",\n    "official_title": "Official Capital of France",\n    "alternative_caps": ["Lyons", "Lyon"]\n  },\n  "population": 3150000\n}\n\nI think that structure provides clear separation between the capital\'s information and its population, keeping it manageable and easy to read. Also, making sure all key facts are included without unnecessary nesting. This way, someone can easily access both the capital\'s info and the population separately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  "capital": {\n    "name": "Paris",\n    "official_name": "The City of Light and

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the information and population of the capital of France. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know. The capital of France is Paris, right? Yeah, that's correct. Now, I need to find the population of Paris. I think it's a major city with a large population, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. I remember hearing that Paris is the most populous city in France, but how big is it compared to other cities?
    
    I think the population of Paris is quite big, maybe around 2 million? Wait, that seems low. I've heard it's over 3 million. Maybe 2.7 million? I should check if that's accurate. Also, I should consider whether the population figure is for the metropolitan area or the urban area. Sometimes cities have different definitions for their areas.
    
    I believe the metropolitan area of Paris includes not just the city proper but also nearby towns and villages. So the population number I'm thinking of might be higher for the metropolitan area. Let me think, maybe 2.8 million? That sounds more plausible. I should also consider the latest data because population numbers can change every year.
    
    I recall that in recent years, Paris has been growing, but not as fast as other parts of France. So the population might be around 2.8 million in 2023. I think that's a reasonable estimate based on what I remember. To be thorough, I should also mention that this is an approximate figure and the actual number might vary slightly depending on the source and the year.
    
    Putting it all together, the JSON format should include the key "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the value 2800000. I should make sure the JSON syntax is correct, using double quotes around the strings and proper commas. So the final JSON would look like {"capital": "Paris", "population": 2800000}.
    
    I think that's it. I should double-check if there's any more information needed, but since the user only asked for the capital and the population, I think this covers it.
    </think>
    
    ```json
    {
      "capital": "Paris",
      "population": 2800000
    }
    ```
