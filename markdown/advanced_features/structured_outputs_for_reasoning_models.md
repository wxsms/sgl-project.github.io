# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")


response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "foo",
            # convert the pydantic model to json schema
            "schema": CapitalInfo.model_json_schema(),
        },
    },
)

print_highlight(
    f"reasoing_content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content}\n\ncontent: {response.choices[0].message.content}"
)
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. I know that the capital of France is Paris, but I'm not exactly sure about the current population numbers. I remember that Paris is a very big city, but I think it's not the largest in the world. Maybe around 20 million? I'm not certain, though. I should probably double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I think I heard somewhere that Paris has a population over 21 million. Maybe 21.6 million? I'm not sure if that's accurate. I should look up the latest data to confirm. Also, I wonder if the population includes just the city proper or the entire metropolitan area. I think sometimes population counts include the broader area, so maybe that's why the number is higher. <br><br>I should make sure to present this information in JSON format as the user requested. So, the key would be "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the number. I need to decide whether to include the metropolitan area or just the city limits. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the metropolitan area population, which I think is around 21.6 million. <br><br>I should also consider the source of this information to ensure accuracy. Maybe the World Bank or recent census data. I recall that the population has been growing steadily, so 21.6 million seems reasonable. I don't think it's too high or too low. <br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have two keys: "capital" and "population". The value for "capital" is "Paris", and "population" is 21600000. I should format it correctly with proper syntax, using quotes and commas where necessary. <br><br>I think that's all. I just need to make sure the information is accurate and present it in the required format.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>


**JSON Schema Directly**



```python

Also, I should make sure that Paris is indeed the capital and not another city like Lyon or Marseille.<br><br>I'm pretty confident that Paris is the capital, but just to be thorough, I'll double-check. The official capital of France is Paris, so that's correct. Now, for the population, I think it's a bit tricky because population numbers can change yearly. I believe the latest data from 2021 puts the population at approximately 21.6 million. But I'm not 100% sure if that's accurate or if it's an average. Maybe it's around 21.5 million? I should present it as an estimate since exact numbers can vary.<br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have the key "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the estimated number. I'll format it properly, making sure the syntax is correct with commas and quotes. I should also mention that the population is an estimate based on the latest available data to avoid any confusion.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

## Native API and SGLang Runtime (SRT)

> Note: For native API, as a work-around, you need to set `require_reasoning` argument to `True` to ensure the model will think before generating the structured output. It's not required for chat-completion API.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, so that\'s straightforward. Now, I should find the most recent population data. I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\n\nI\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census. Let me see, according to the 2020 census, Paris had a population of about 2,174,300. That seems accurate. I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\n\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\'ll create an object with a "name" field for the capital, a "general_information" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a "population" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\n\nI should also add a "source" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\n\nPutting it all together, I\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive. I\'ll make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.\n\nFinally, I\'ll present the JSON in a code block so the user can easily copy and use it.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, so the user asked for the capital of France along with its population. Let me take a closer look at their query. They want this information in JSON format. Hmm, JSON is a common data format, so they\'re probably looking for a structured response, maybe to integrate it into another application.\n\nFirst, identifying the key pieces of information needed: the name of the capital city, which is definitely Paris, and its population. But wait, the population figure can change over time. I should make sure it\'s up to date. I remember the latest data was around September 2023, but the exact number might vary slightly depending on the source.\n\nI\'ll need to include both the name of the city and the population in a JSON structure. Also, including the country name as a property adds context, so people know where this population figure belongs. Maybe the user is building a fact-checking tool or a data analysis project, so presenting it clearly in JSON makes sense.\n\nI should format it properly, using the correct syntax for JSON keys and string values. I\'ll use double quotes for the city names and ensure numbers are formatted correctly without commas for readability. Finally, adding a comment that specifies the population year gives the user an idea of when the data was current, just in case they need to verify it.\n</think>\n\nHere is the information in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  "capital": "Paris",\n  "population": 905136,\n  "country": "France"\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object contains the following details:\n- `capital`: The name of the capital city of France.\n- `population`: The population of the capital city (as of 2023).\n- `country`: The country where the capital city is located.', 'output_ids': [71486, 11, 773, 279, 1196, 4588, 369, 279, 6722, 315, 9625, 3156, 448, 1181, 7042, 13, 6771, 752, 1896, 264, 12128, 1401, 518, 862, 3239, 13, 2379, 1366, 419, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 13, 88190, 11, 4718, 374, 264, 4185, 821, 3561, 11, 773, 807, 2299, 4658, 3330, 369, 264, 32930, 2033, 11, 7196, 311, 31072, 432, 1119, 2441, 3766, 382, 5338, 11, 24588, 279, 1376, 9666, 315, 1995, 4362, 25, 279, 829, 315, 279, 6722, 3283, 11, 892, 374, 8491, 12095, 11, 323, 1181, 7042, 13, 1988, 3783, 11, 279, 7042, 7071, 646, 2297, 916, 882, 13, 358, 1265, 1281, 2704, 432, 594, 705, 311, 2400, 13, 358, 6099, 279, 5535, 821, 572, 2163, 6122, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 11, 714, 279, 4734, 1372, 2578, 13289, 10078, 11649, 389, 279, 2530, 382, 40, 3278, 1184, 311, 2924, 2176, 279, 829, 315, 279, 3283, 323, 279, 7042, 304, 264, 4718, 5944, 13, 7281, 11, 2670, 279, 3146, 829, 438, 264, 3343, 11367, 2266, 11, 773, 1251, 1414, 1380, 419, 7042, 7071, 17180, 13, 10696, 279, 1196, 374, 4752, 264, 2097, 15934, 287, 5392, 476, 264, 821, 6358, 2390, 11, 773, 31544, 432, 9355, 304, 4718, 3643, 5530, 382, 40, 1265, 3561, 432, 10277, 11, 1667, 279, 4396, 19482, 369, 4718, 6894, 323, 914, 2750, 13, 358, 3278, 990, 1990, 17194, 369, 279, 3283, 5036, 323, 5978, 5109, 525, 23126, 12440, 2041, 76602, 369, 91494, 13, 17375, 11, 7842, 264, 3980, 429, 29102, 279, 7042, 1042, 6696, 279, 1196, 458, 4522, 315, 979, 279, 821, 572, 1482, 11, 1101, 304, 1142, 807, 1184, 311, 10146, 432, 624, 151649, 271, 8420, 374, 279, 1995, 304, 4718, 3561, 1447, 73594, 2236, 198, 515, 220, 330, 65063, 788, 330, 59604, 756, 220, 330, 44441, 788, 220, 24, 15, 20, 16, 18, 21, 345, 220, 330, 11141, 788, 330, 49000, 698, 532, 13874, 19324, 1986, 4718, 1633, 5610, 279, 2701, 3565, 510, 12, 1565, 65063, 44622, 576, 829, 315, 279, 6722, 3283, 315, 9625, 624, 12, 1565, 44441, 44622, 576, 7042, 315, 279, 6722, 3283, 320, 300, 315, 220, 17, 15, 17, 18, 4292, 12, 1565, 11141, 44622, 576, 3146, 1380, 279, 6722, 3283, 374, 7407, 13, 151643], 'meta_info': {'id': '98165da9fb264cadac6569cb59c4b378', 'finish_reason': {'type': 'stop', 'matched': 151643}, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'weight_version': 'default', 'total_retractions': 0, 'completion_tokens': 364, 'cached_tokens': 22, 'cached_tokens_details': None, 'e2e_latency': 2.3226969242095947, 'response_sent_to_client_ts': 1771212250.552007}}</strong>

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. Let me start by recalling what I know about France. I know that Paris is the capital of France. That part is pretty clear to me. Now, about the population—I think it's a big city, but I'm not exactly sure how many people live there. I remember hearing that it's over 3 million, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should check some sources or think about recent data.
    
    I also recall that population figures can vary each year due to births, deaths, and migration. So the number might not be exactly static. I think the last time I heard, Paris had around 3.5 million people. But I should verify that. Also, I wonder if the population figure includes only the city proper or includes the entire metropolitan area. I think sometimes population counts can refer to the urban area, which might be larger than just the city limits.
    
    Wait, another thing—does the population include all residents or just the permanent ones? I think it's usually the total population, including temporary residents and those who are residents for part of the year. So, in that case, the number would be higher. Maybe around 3.7 million? But I'm not sure if that's the latest estimate.
    
    I also think about how populations are measured. They probably use data from the census, which is conducted periodically. I believe France has a census every ten years, so the most recent one might have been a few years ago. That would make the figure slightly outdated, but it's a good starting point.
    
    Another aspect is that Paris is the capital, but other major cities in France are Lyon, Marseille, and Lille. They are significant too, but I don't think they're the main ones. So focusing on Paris for the population makes sense.
    
    I also consider the factors affecting the population. For example, immigration can increase numbers, while emigration can decrease them. Economic factors also play a role; jobs in the city can attract people, while lack of opportunities might make people leave. So the population can change based on these dynamics.
    
    In terms of sources, I might look up recent census data or official statistics from the French National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INSEE) for the most accurate information. They usually provide detailed reports on urban populations, which would be reliable.
    
    Wait, I should also think about the urban agglomeration. The metropolitan area of Paris includes neighboring towns and regions, which might add a significant number to the population. So the metropolitan area population could be higher than the city proper's population.
    
    Putting this all together, I think Paris has a population around 3.5 to 3.7 million, maybe a bit higher, but I'm not entirely sure of the exact number. I'll go with 3.5 million as a general estimate, keeping in mind that it can vary slightly depending on the source and the time of the year.
    
    So, to summarize, the capital of France is Paris, and its population is approximately 3.5 million people. I should present this information in a clear JSON format as requested.
