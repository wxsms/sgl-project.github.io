# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")


response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "foo",
            # convert the pydantic model to json schema
            "schema": CapitalInfo.model_json_schema(),
        },
    },
)

print_highlight(
    f"reasoing_content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content}\n\ncontent: {response.choices[0].message.content}"
)
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. I know that the capital of France is Paris, but I'm not exactly sure about the current population numbers. I remember that Paris is a very big city, but I think it's not the largest in the world. Maybe around 20 million? I'm not certain, though. I should probably double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I think I heard somewhere that Paris has a population over 21 million. Maybe 21.6 million? I'm not sure if that's accurate. I should look up the latest data to confirm. Also, I wonder if the population includes just the city proper or the entire metropolitan area. I think sometimes population counts include the broader area, so maybe that's why the number is higher. <br><br>I should make sure to present this information in JSON format as the user requested. So, the key would be "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the number. I need to decide whether to include the metropolitan area or just the city limits. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the metropolitan area population, which I think is around 21.6 million. <br><br>I should also consider the source of this information to ensure accuracy. Maybe the World Bank or recent census data. I recall that the population has been growing steadily, so 21.6 million seems reasonable. I don't think it's too high or too low. <br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have two keys: "capital" and "population". The value for "capital" is "Paris", and "population" is 21600000. I should format it correctly with proper syntax, using quotes and commas where necessary. <br><br>I think that's all. I just need to make sure the information is accurate and present it in the required format.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>


**JSON Schema Directly**



```python

Also, I should make sure that Paris is indeed the capital and not another city like Lyon or Marseille.<br><br>I'm pretty confident that Paris is the capital, but just to be thorough, I'll double-check. The official capital of France is Paris, so that's correct. Now, for the population, I think it's a bit tricky because population numbers can change yearly. I believe the latest data from 2021 puts the population at approximately 21.6 million. But I'm not 100% sure if that's accurate or if it's an average. Maybe it's around 21.5 million? I should present it as an estimate since exact numbers can vary.<br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have the key "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the estimated number. I'll format it properly, making sure the syntax is correct with commas and quotes. I should also mention that the population is an estimate based on the latest available data to avoid any confusion.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

## Native API and SGLang Runtime (SRT)

> Note: For native API, as a work-around, you need to set `require_reasoning` argument to `True` to ensure the model will think before generating the structured output. It's not required for chat-completion API.

Maybe I should double-check that. \n\nWait, I recall that the population figure can vary depending on the source and the year.

I believe the population is around 3,500,000 as of 2023. \n\nNow, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. JSON typically uses key-value pairs, so I\'ll create an object with keys like "city", "population", and maybe "country" since the user mentioned France. \n\nI should make sure the keys are in English to keep it clear. The city is Paris, the population is 3,500,000, and the country is France. I\'ll format this into a JSON object. \n\nI also need to present this in a way that\'s easy to read, so I\'ll use proper syntax with quotation marks and commas in the right places.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Okay, so the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France, which is Paris. They want this data in JSON format. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key pieces of information required. The main points would be the name of the city, its population, and the current country it\'s in, along with the country\'s population. It seems like they might need this for a quick reference or perhaps a project that requires population stats and country info.\n\nWait, but I remember from the previous response that the population of Paris is around 2.1 million, but it\'s not fixed. Cities can grow or decline over time. I should advise them to check a reliable source for the most up-to-date information. Maybe I should also consider other factors, like birth rate, death rate, and net migration to give a more comprehensive picture.\n\nI wonder, should I include some context about why Paris is the capital, like its historical significance? The user might be interested in background as well. But they specifically asked for information and population, so perhaps sticking to those points is better.\n\nAnother thing to think about: in JSON format, it\'s important to structure the data clearly. Using nested objects can make the information easy to read and reference. Maybe something like "capital" containing the city name, pop_data with current population, and some additional metadata like whether the data is from a specific year.\n\nAlso, should I include unit abbreviations? Probably not in JSON, so I\'ll have to make sure to use kilo, mega, etc., as appropriate without the units. Oh, wait, in my first response, I said population around 2.1 million. Now, I realize the exact number might fluctuate, so maybe 2,109,000 is more accurate as of a recent estimate.\n\nBut wait, I recall that Paris\'s population can be a bit volatile depending on the source. I should mention that the figure is approximate. Alternatively, providing a range along with the average might help. However, for simplicity, a single number with a source, like the INSEE database as of December 2024, could be sufficient.\n\nIn terms of the country\'s population, I should also check the latest data. As of then, France has around 40 million people, but again, it\'s important to mention that this can change over time due to the same factors affecting Paris\'s population.\n\nI should make sure to format everything correctly in JSON, avoiding any markdown and keeping it clean. Breaking the information into smaller objects under the "capital" key will make it more organized.\n\nOh, and the user might be using this data for a presentation or a report, so accuracy is key. Providing it in a reliable format like JSON ensures they can integrate it into their work without issues.\n\nFinally, I\'ll offer further assistance in case they need help formatting or extracting specific data from the JSON. That way, they know they can reach out if they have more questions or need adjustments.\n</think>\n\nHere is the information and population of the capital of France (Paris) in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  "capital": {\n    "name": "Paris",\n    "population": {\n      "current": "2109000",\n      "unit": " residents as of the latest estimate (2024)"\n    },\n    "country": {\n

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Alright, so the user just asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Hmm, okay, let me break this down. 
    
    First, I need to identify the capital of France. I know that Paris is the capital, but I should double-check that to be sure. Yeah, Paris is definitely the capital city of France, so that's settled.
    
    Next, they want the population. I remember that populations can change over time, so I should look for the most recent data. I think the population is around 2 million, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact number. Maybe it's 2,100,000 or something close to that. I should verify this information to provide an accurate figure.
    
    Now, they specified the JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data. So, I need to create a JSON object that includes the city name and population. The key should be "capital" and "population" respectively, with their respective values.
    
    I should make sure that the JSON syntax is correct. That means using double quotes around the keys and string values, and proper commas between the key-value pairs. Also, the numbers should be in the correct format without any extra spaces that might cause errors.
    
    Putting it all together, the JSON object would have the city name as a string and the population as an integer. I'll format it neatly so it's easy to read and copy.
    
    Wait, should I mention anything about the population being approximate? Maybe add a note that the number might vary slightly depending on the source or year. That way, the user knows there could be a bit of variation.
    
    I think that's all. Just need to present the information clearly and accurately in the specified format.
    </think>
    
    Here is the information about the capital of France in JSON format:
    
    ```json
    {
      "capital": "Paris",
      "population": 2100000
    }
    ```
    
    Note: The population figure is approximate and may vary depending on the source or year.
