# Structured Outputs For Reasoning Models

When working with reasoning models that use special tokens like `<think>...</think>` to denote reasoning sections, you might want to allow free-form text within these sections while still enforcing grammar constraints on the rest of the output.

SGLang provides a feature to disable grammar restrictions within reasoning sections. This is particularly useful for models that need to perform complex reasoning steps before providing a structured output.

To enable this feature, use the `--reasoning-parser` flag which decide the think_end_token, such as `</think>`, when launching the server. You can also specify the reasoning parser using the `--reasoning-parser` flag.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports the following reasoning models:
- [DeepSeek R1 series](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.
- [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B): The reasoning content is wrapped with `<think>` and `</think>` tags.


## Usage

## OpenAI Compatible API

Specify the `--grammar-backend`, `--reasoning-parser` option.


```python
import openai
import os

from sglang.test.doc_patch import launch_server_cmd
from sglang.utils import wait_for_server, print_highlight, terminate_process

os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"


server_process, port = launch_server_cmd(
    "python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B --host 0.0.0.0 --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1 --log-level warning"
)

wait_for_server(f"http://localhost:{port}", process=server_process)
client = openai.Client(base_url=f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1", api_key="None")
```

### JSON

you can directly define a JSON schema or use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to define and validate the response.

**Using Pydantic**


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Define the schema using Pydantic
class CapitalInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., pattern=r"^\w+$", description="Name of the capital city")
    population: int = Field(..., description="Population of the capital city")


response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.",
        },
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "foo",
            # convert the pydantic model to json schema
            "schema": CapitalInfo.model_json_schema(),
        },
    },
)

print_highlight(
    f"reasoing_content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content}\n\ncontent: {response.choices[0].message.content}"
)
```


<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France and its population. I know that the capital of France is Paris, but I'm not exactly sure about the current population numbers. I remember that Paris is a very big city, but I think it's not the largest in the world. Maybe around 20 million? I'm not certain, though. I should probably double-check that. <br><br>Wait, I think I heard somewhere that Paris has a population over 21 million. Maybe 21.6 million? I'm not sure if that's accurate. I should look up the latest data to confirm. Also, I wonder if the population includes just the city proper or the entire metropolitan area. I think sometimes population counts include the broader area, so maybe that's why the number is higher. <br><br>I should make sure to present this information in JSON format as the user requested. So, the key would be "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the number. I need to decide whether to include the metropolitan area or just the city limits. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the metropolitan area population, which I think is around 21.6 million. <br><br>I should also consider the source of this information to ensure accuracy. Maybe the World Bank or recent census data. I recall that the population has been growing steadily, so 21.6 million seems reasonable. I don't think it's too high or too low. <br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have two keys: "capital" and "population". The value for "capital" is "Paris", and "population" is 21600000. I should format it correctly with proper syntax, using quotes and commas where necessary. <br><br>I think that's all. I just need to make sure the information is accurate and present it in the required format.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>


**JSON Schema Directly**



```python

I recall reading somewhere that it's over 21 million now. Maybe around 21.6 million? I'm not sure if that's the exact number or just an estimate. I should look it up to confirm. Also, I should make sure that Paris is indeed the capital and not another city like Lyon or Marseille.<br><br>I'm pretty confident that Paris is the capital, but just to be thorough, I'll double-check. The official capital of France is Paris, so that's correct. Now, for the population, I think it's a bit tricky because population numbers can change yearly. I believe the latest data from 2021 puts the population at approximately 21.6 million. But I'm not 100% sure if that's accurate or if it's an average. Maybe it's around 21.5 million? I should present it as an estimate since exact numbers can vary.<br><br>So, putting it all together, the JSON should have the key "capital" with the value "Paris" and another key "population" with the estimated number. I'll format it properly, making sure the syntax is correct with commas and quotes. I should also mention that the population is an estimate based on the latest available data to avoid any confusion.<br><br><br>content: {<br><br>"name": "Paris",<br>"population": 21600000<br>}</strong>

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>reasoing_content: Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I remember learning about France in school, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. I know that Paris is a major city in France, and it's often referred to as the "City of Light." People go there for museums, landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and it's a cultural hub. But is it the capital?<br><br>Wait, I think the capital is the official seat of government, right? So maybe Paris is both the capital and the most famous city. But I'm not entirely certain. I recall that some countries have their capital in a different city than their main tourist attraction. For example, I think Brazil's capital is not Rio de Janeiro, which is more famous. So maybe France is like that too.<br><br>Let me try to remember any specific information. I think the French government declares Paris as the capital. I've heard that before. Also, I remember learning that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is a symbol of the city, but not necessarily the government building. The government buildings are probably in another part of the city or in a different city altogether.<br><br>Wait, no, I think the government buildings are in Paris. Maybe the Palace of Consultation or something like that. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I'm pretty sure Paris is where the government offices are located. So that would make Paris the capital.<br><br>I also think that sometimes people confuse the capital with the administrative center, but in France, I believe the administrative center is in Toulouse, but the capital is still Paris. So even though Toulouse is the main hub for government agencies, Paris is where the president and prime minister are located.<br><br>So putting it all together, Paris is the capital of France because it's the seat of government, even though it's also the most well-known city in the country. I think that's correct, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact administrative details. Maybe I should double-check, but from what I remember, Paris is definitely the capital.<br><br><br>content: Paris</strong>

## Native API and SGLang Runtime (SRT)

> Note: For native API, as a work-around, you need to set `require_reasoning` argument to `True` to ensure the model will think before generating the structured output. It's not required for chat-completion API.

I remember that the population of Paris has been growing, but I\'m not sure of the exact number. I think it\'s around 2 million, but I should verify that.\n\nI\'ll check a reliable source, maybe the official Paris Municipality website or a recent census.

I should make sure to include this number in the JSON.\n\nNext, I need to structure this information into a JSON format. The user wants both the general information and the population. So, I\'ll create an object with a "name" field for the capital, a "general_information" section that includes the administrative center, area, and government department, and a "population" section that includes the current population and a note about the data source.\n\nI should also add a "source" field to indicate where the population data comes from, which is the 2020 census. This makes the information more transparent and trustworthy.\n\nPutting it all together, I\'ll format the JSON with proper syntax, using double quotes for strings and ensuring that the keys are clear and descriptive.

<strong style='color: #00008B;'>{'text': 'Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, the user is asking for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Okay, the capital of France is Paris, that much I remember. Now, I need to get the current population. Wait, I\'m not sure about the exact number, but I think it\'s around 3 million. I should double-check that to make sure I don\'t give an outdated figure.\n\nHmm, if I\'m not certain, maybe I should present it as an approximate value. Also, the user specifically asked for JSON format, so I need to structure the answer correctly. Let me outline what the JSON should look like. It should have a key for the city name and another for population. Using proper syntax is important here to avoid errors.\n\nI wonder if the user is a student working on a project or maybe someone looking for quick factual data. Either way, providing a precise answer is key. If I\'m unsure about the population, maybe I should mention that it\'s an estimate and note the year if possible. That way, the user knows the information is current.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the format. JSON needs strings to be in quotes and numerical values without quotes. So the population should be a number. Let me make sure I don\'t mix up the data types. Putting it all together, the JSON structure should be something like {"city": "Paris", "population": 3000000}. \n\nI think that\'s all they\'re asking for, but maybe they want more details like area or other statistics.

    Prompt: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜>Give me the information and population of the capital of France in the JSON format.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜Assistant｜><think>
    
    Generated text: Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request. They asked for the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format. Let me break this down.
    
    First, I know that the capital of France is Paris. That's pretty straightforward. Now, they want the population. I remember that Paris is a very large city, so the population is going to be in the millions. I think the current population is around 2 million, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check if the population has changed recently. I recall that sometimes cities can see growth, especially if there are new developments or if people are moving in.
    
    Wait, but since the user didn't specify a year, I should probably go with the most recent estimate. I believe in recent years, Paris has been growing a bit, so maybe 2.2 million or so. I should make sure to include that number accurately.
    
    Now, the user wants this information in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to structure data. I need to create an object with the key-value pairs. The keys should be "city" and "population". The city is obviously "Paris", and the population is the number I just thought of, which is approximately 2.2 million.
    
    I should format the JSON correctly. In JSON, numbers should be in quotes, and strings should also be in quotes. So it would look like {"city": "Paris", "population": 2200000}. That seems right.
    
    Wait, should I use a comma after the population number? No, in JSON, commas separate the key-value pairs, so that's correct. Also, I should make sure the JSON is valid. Maybe I should double-check the syntax, but I think it's fine here.
    
    Is there anything else I need to consider? The user didn't specify any particular date or source, so I'll just go with the general population figure. I don't want to include something outdated or incorrect, so I'll stick with the latest estimate I have.
    
    In summary, the JSON object should have the city "Paris" and the population as 2200000. That's straightforward. I don't think I'm missing anything here. I'll present it in the correct format as per the user's request.
    </think>
    
    Here is the information and population of the capital of France in JSON format:
    
    ```json
    {
      "city": "Paris",
      "population": 2200000
    }
    ```



```python
llm.shutdown()
```
